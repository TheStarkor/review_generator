5,"I received a 3.5mm male jack, but have easily fixed this foible with an adapter for $0.90.",0
6,Thought about trying others just to compare but had to stick with this great product at a great price.,0
7,"I'm not sure whether if the sound had to do with the apple products, but both the Sony headphones, and my old generic $10.00  store bought headphones produced the same sound.",0
8,"Got these headphones based on a review in a magazine, and it was spot on.",0
9,"It remains to be seen how the collapsible neck piece stands up, but initial build quality seems good.",0
10,"I wish they were smaller, and I'd like a version that goes over the top of the head (instead of over the back).",0
11,"I had purchased a much more expensive, brand name set and found they hurt my ears.",0
12,I bought one of these 2 years ago.,0
13,The only difference between these functions it how long the button is held or whether it is hit more than once.,0

15,"They are moderately comfortable, but can get a bit painful when using them for a long period of time.",0

18,It has pretty long range too?,0

After trying to use these things for a month I've given up.",1

29,Light weight and good sound quality (it's no Bose but decent for the price).,1
30,"Now, these headphones will not blow you away in terms of audio performance, and this was not the reason that I purchased and/or love them.",1
31,They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these).,1
32,They are snug and perhaps painful with extended use.,1
33,"these are nice, the bluetooth connection and not having to use a wire is nice, but these weren't loud enough for me, I used these in the gym the first day and it didn't block out all the gym noises like with my regular apple ear pods",1
34,The units fit snuggly behind my ears providing clear listening and comfort.,1
35,They fit my grand-daughter's head perfect so they can listen to television without disturbing others.,1

39,Update: The company contacted me.,1
40,I bought this pair to replace my Sony MDR-V150 headphones which have deteriorating ear pads.,1
41,The sound is good for the price and the wire is not flimsy.,1
42,"It should be noted that they can be had from Best Buy for $20 with free shipping, rather than the $40 amazon is at right now.",1
43,I was skeptical when I purchased these headphones because of the low price.,1
44,I got these to replace in-ear headphones because I'm prone to ear infections but geez even with the volume turned way up they don't block outside noise at all.,1
45,I need a little tighter fit to make them a 5 star rating.,1
46,"I don't care much about audio quality beyond a certain level of competence, but have gone through dozens of headphone models, and these are decent on that count, certainly better than your typical earbuds.",1
47,The bass has punch (although still not going to deliver what I'm _really_ looking for) and the highs are clean.,1
48,"For the price, these are unbeatable.",1
49,And plenty of reviewers here swear by their comfort and ability to stay on while exercising.,1
50,The only drawback was they weren't long enough to watch my tv from bed.,2
51,Decent bass response.,2
52,Worked for about 5 months before dying.,2

61,You won't regret it!,2
62,"I thought she was old enough for this style rather than just ear buds, and for the cost of a modest set of buds, these are really good-sounding, well-designed headphones.",2
63,Guess I'll never know that though.,2
64,The ear padding gets really wet for me and feels slippery which creates an uncomfortable feeling.,2
65,They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these).,2
66,They come with a micro usb charging cable and a velvet-like pouch for storage.,2
67,Cups/cans are too small to go around your ear.,2
68,Happy with the price point and glad I purchased them.,2
69,"I think either the technology is still evolving or better technology is still costly or else, speakers at this cost are meant to be this way.",2
70,Why wouldnt you buy these they are perfect for jogging or taking to school to and plug into your laptop.,2
71,I've had mine for two years and it's still going strong!,2

83,The controls are very intuitive.,3
84,If I move my head up or down it moves the earpieces.,3
85,These can be bought for prices as low as $14 or $12.,3
86,"The 10 hour battery life isn't a big deal, as I only use them for listening to music at work, and I charge them overnight.",3
87,"Skeptics guide to the universe is my favorite, cheap plug while i have the chance, and it sounds awesome.",3
88,"They work fine, but the sound quality is typical of $20 headphones.",3
89,2) The headphones don't fit very snug.,3
90,"""I listen to my radio at a reasonable volume.""",3
91,"I've had them for over two hours, listening to Alpha/ BiNatural beats while reading.",3

102,So I rate 4 stars.,4
103,Most of people said it is good for all part.,4
104,Worked for about 5 months before dying.,4
105,I would say they look better and they seemed a bit smaller around the head but overall I prefer the SoundBot's in this price range.,4
106,Mid range and bass sound flabby and out of shape causing the highs to sound choppy.,4
107,"when they arrived, at first look I was worried about the non-adjustability of these because,as a female, my head is kinda small, but they fit OK.",4
108,The sound is decent and they are pretty sturdy.,4

119,"I have owned many Koss's, Sennheiser's, Sony's, Audio Technica's, and even some Bose.",4
120,These headphones are a godsend.,4
121,i think they are better then just basic ear budds.,4
122,"However, if you can spend a little bit more, I would suggest spending 100-200$ for a much punchier and clearer sound.",4
123,There was a lack of bass compared to my Sony MDR-XB500's.,4
124,I also own the venerable V6's.,4
125,"I use them on my bike trainer so I can watch TV without having to turn the volume up to 100, and I don't have to adjust them every 5 seconds.",5

143,Some people have talked about the lack of bass.,5
144,"- Very affordable

Cons:
  - No battery indicator, but it starts beeping in your ear when it's getting low.",5

154,We could go through about 8 of these in a year and still not hit the prices of one pair of Beats!,6
155,Bluetooth should work within 30 feet.,6
156,"Anyway I was looking for the dj style that covers the ears and provide at least some noise reduction, for under 20 doll-hairs.",6
157,Luckily the main box was fine and nothing was broken.,6
158,"My only complaint about these is that they emphasize bass a little too much, but they're definitely a solid option if you're looking for an inexpensive set of headphones for your office or when you're on the subway.",6
159,This was my ideal situation!,6
160,The sound quality isn't so good but the looks and brand name of Sony alone make up for it.,6
161,"The sound quality is not breathtaking my any means, but I believe a very good value for the price.",6
162,Dollar for dollar you cant beat this product.,6
163,I really wanted to get away from the wired ear buds I was using in the office as I would rip them out anytime I turned around.,6
164,Volume and Track control right on the ear for great hands free use.,6
165,But it's a good deal for what I'm using it for.,6
166,"Comfortable, and sound quality is decent enough you don't hate life.",6
167,Just pay attention to the short instructions and this headset could not be easier to connect (Windows 8.1).,6
168,It was delivered one day ahead of the scheduled date.,6
169,"However, it would be even better of they had the option to connect to devices that do not carry the blue tooth feature.",6

174,"Not too flexible, so wide heads may have difficulty.",6

176,The cord is still 8ft but the head set is comparable in size to the Sony's.,7
177,I felt they were going to fall off at any moment.,7
178,"i was discussed with the sound quality of these headphones, Sony dropped the ball on these.",7
179,"I have only had the headphones for a day, but I am impressed.",7
180,I'm just a reg joe and I also have a pair of boss and a pair of beats.... but I use these for work and I bring them home so the kids use.....,7
181,I can't understand how these are so highly rated.,7
182,The bass is weak and oppressed.,7
183,They block background noise well!,7
184,The control buttons work smoothly and my iPhone 6 connected immediately and the calls are easy to answer and crystal clear.,7

188,-connectivity issue.,7
189,"Works fine, but not satisfied with quality.",7
190,Your guess is as good as mine!,7
191,I would definitely recommend them!,7
192,I'm sure others like this option but it does not fit my needs.,7
193,I was skeptical getting these as I'm coming from having Rocket Fish bluetooth headphones.,7
194,My earbuds are stronger and are more comfortable.,7

200,One of the speaker has stopped working and I can't use it any longer.,8
201,"Well, when compared against my old Sony noise canceling ones, these are pathetic.",8
202,Love how you can adjust for comfort.,8
203,"But again, it lacks the hardshell protection from heavier objects.",8
204,"My only quibbles are the fit (they keep sliding off of my ears -- I have small ears and long hair that tucks behind my ears and I often wear the headphones and sunglasses at the same time, and the headphones won't stay on.",8
205,"Good for music and calls , do not recommend for work outs, they fit behind the head and have a tendency to fall off .",8
206,For the past 12 years I've always bought LabTec 820's but since they've stop making those I had to resort to these headphones.,8
207,"Well, these dont... they're smaller than they look... they sit ON your ear, not OVER it.",8

209,I'll update this review in a few months when they're good and burned in and I get them away from him for a bit to listen again.,8

216,He has nothing but great things to say about this product.,8
217,"But as they are, I cannot recommend them.",8
218,The sound quality is better than about 95% of the other headphones I've ever owned (all were wired).,8
219,"Sound is balanced, not too much of anything (so the bass wasn't that good for electronic music and such, but it was there)but a little muffled.",8
220,"Though, this is going to vary on a person by person basis",8
221,"I don't expect bose quality on a $30 pair of headphones, but they are pretty darn good!",8
222,I've used them regularly for several months now and am still pleased with the quality.,8

233,These are my primary headphones doe.,9
234,They are compact and lightweight.,9
235,"Sounds like a $50 pair of headphones, not a $15...VERY worth it.",9
236,I'd give it 5 stars for sound and comfort.,9
237,"Overall: decent headphones, obviously they're $15 so they're not great, but they do good enough.",9
238,The only issue I have ever had is after 5 years of continuous use and abuse the headband has become loose (grip wise) so when I bend down they have a tendency to start slipping off.,9
239,"Now, I figured since it was suck a bargain there would be a catch, and of course there was.",9
240,I didn't realize how much I missed the bass that my earbuds didn't supply.,9
241,They will amaze you!,9

243,My teenage son uses them constantly and hasn't had any problems.,9
244,They fold up nicely.,9
245,It is does not have noise reduction but since it is cheap it is worth it.,9

260,"great product i strongly recommend it, shiped very very fast it came in a day ahead, also it paired at once the voume is great and I use it on my galaxy 8 tablet",10
261,These headphones... Wow.,10
262,These headphones are hard to beat for the price.,10
263,i was considering for weeks getting some dre beats headphones for my workouts but for 200 dollars they better come with a mobile personal DJ.. gave these a try and am very happy with the sound and comfort and saving $175 for the holidays,10
264,The collapsible headphones make for easy storage but because of this the headphones are small on the head.,10

273,"Well, when compared against my old Sony noise canceling ones, these are pathetic.",10
274,"It also can't seem to communicate properly with my iphone, so that the phone constantly flips over to loudspeaker mode.",10
275,I checked out the Amazon reviews and also noticed that thewirecutter.com gave them a very good review.,11
276,They don't really serve the purpose for what I wanted them for.,11
277,I've looked up how to fix this online and tried other earbuds/headphones and they worked just fine on my computer.,11

287,I bought this for my 14-year-old.,11
288,Had them for only about a few weeks and they are busted....just buy something else.,11
289,"All other affordable headphones have only lasted me a few months, so, needless to say, I was very pleased with this pair.",11

291,I was amazed by the quality of these headphones.,11
292,This is my second set of these to keep separate places so I don't ever forget a pair.,11
293,I was also very surprised at how comfortable they are.,11
294,These have held up for months without issue.,11
295,Every so often they start to cut out even if my phone is in my hand or nearby.,11

307,Range is easily to into the next room of my electronically noisy house.,12
308,Wonderful headphones.,12
309,The MDRZX100 are going to a trash bin.,12
310,Decent sound for the price.,12
311,They stay in place while running and can get loud enough to block out surrounding noise.,12
312,"These did the trick, and for less than 20 dollars.",12
313,These headphones are a pleasant surprise.,12
314,"However, it does it's job quite well overall.",12
315,Had a white pair that's lasted me 4+ years and bought this pair for my boyfriend because his previous pair from Zagg had a cord that broke after one year.,12
316,These are classics.,12
317,These are not the best headphones ever but the sound quality is about the same as a pair of $100 headphones.,12
318,So if it has perfect sound...I can't judge.,12
319,I really look forward to the times when there isn't a lot of background noise and I get to put these on.,12
320,"Can go anywhere in my 2 story house, including the basement with good signal from the tablet.",12
321,The ear cups are a little small for me.,12
322,I was surprised how easy it was to set up.,12
323,He loves these headphones and takes them to the gym with him because he likes to listen to music or talk on the phone without having to worry about a cord.,12
324,I have used the bth220 model for the past year and love them but wanted a second pair.,12
325,"It should be noted that they can be had from Best Buy for $20 with free shipping, rather than the $40 amazon is at right now.",13
326,I purchased a headset before these for 11 dollars and the connection on those were beyond better than the kinivo set.,13
327,"Although I received this item as ""refurbished"", it looks brand new and is in PERFECT working condition.",13
328,"The sound quality is more improved than the original, and while these headphones do not isolate the user from his or her surroundings, the audio quality is still very crisp and clear.",13
329,"I'm not sure if they will be durable just thrown in a bag, I think I'll have to be careful with them...",13
330,I bought one for work then I bought another for home.,13
331,"Bought these on: August 8, 2014.",13
332,I bought those back in May 2013 and am just now going to purchase a new set.,13
333,"The price is so good, that I had trouble justifying paying the same amount for a protective case for them, so they won't get banged up in my backpack.",13
334,If you are looking for legit stereo sound without paying an outrageous amount these are for you.,13
335,"If you sit or lay in absolute darkness, they can light up half the room lol.",13
336,I trust and love Kiniv.,13
337,The head size is decent (I have a big head and it fits over my head comfortably).,13
338,"Also, the sound was fine, but wasn't near the quality of my $30 Sony headphones that were wired.",13
339,The price is certainly right.,13
340,I was a little worried that these would be junk... but they are awesome.,13
341,Small children I have.,13
342,After two days of having them the right side of the headphones stopped working.,13
343,"The unit connects well to my Samsung phone, good sound, etc.",13
344,I wouldn't recommend these.,13
345,Headphone is very lightweight and confortable.,13
346,I've been through a few head phones so I was something of a skeptic.,13
347,The wrap around style is super comfortable and never bounces/falls off.,13
348,I bought these a long time ago and let me first say that these last.,13
349,But there are other affordable options out there that perform a little better.,13
350,My daughter is happy to have it as it matches with her laptop colour and look expensive too with SONY logo on the earpieces.,14
351,"I will divide and conquer by category:

Sound: The sound is the main thing.",14
352,I'm still contemplating reordering because I do like them.,14
353,Inexpensive and works fine.,14
354,"During a workout, my music will gradually lower to min volume and then start beeping (because it hit the volume min limit).",14
355,I would press the wrong button and ignore a call rather than answering it.,14
356,"Now, I figured since it was suck a bargain there would be a catch, and of course there was.",14
357,Also better construction than I dreamed for the price.,14
358,She uses them with her iPod shuffle or watching movies on the computer.,14
359,The various control buttons operate with a nice firm 'click' and their positions are easily remembered.,14
360,Built quality is sub par and very disappointing emotions.,14
361,Due to their wireless nature I believe these will be more durable than wired headphones.,14
362,"This have good sound and okay bass,  they do need more treble but overall good product for the price.",14
363,"Haven't really tested out the battery life or durability yet, but I suspect they will be more than sufficient.",14
364,"I honestly got these as a secondary pair, when I don't feel like using or lending anyone my Bose.",14
365,Feels very comfortable.,14
366,Bought them as gifts for directors who were competing at a marching band event and they loved them!!!,14
367,"I had to replace them, not because they stopped working, but because I broke them trying to remove the hard plastic bar that wraps around the back of the head.",14
368,If you can find the right sized replacement.,14
369,"Behringer phones best sound output, bests the Philips, can handle volume, but emit vinyl fumes.",14
370,"With those few cons in mind, they produced admirable sound quality, paired easily and never lost connection with my phone, and most importantly don't have cords and stayed on my ears!",14
371,I now feel like I have either an oversized head or ears.,14
372,It also costed like 26 bucks.,14
373,"Because of this, this is something that's a must and these are not very loud.",14
374,*Bluetooth connectivity was a breeze (I have a Pantech Marauder android phone that found the head phones in 5 seconds).,14
375,As a telephone - sound quality when receiving and sending - I was not as impressed.,15
376,I do understand that these are on ear headphones with small drivers.,15
377,I use them on my daily walk.,15
378,Good quality stereo headphones and very attractively priced!,15
379,Only thing that is on the bad side (and it may be a similar problem with other headphones) is how to keep the cord tied down to the headphones when not in use.,15
380,I had to call Apple and they were able to help me pair it.,15
381,It's OK if you're not very picky about the sound of your music.,15
382,The price was nice ($25) they arrived the next day and I started using them immediately.,15
383,"I originally bought them to wear at the gym, and they work exceptionally well for that.",15
384,"Edit: Long time later: Feb 2016  These headphones are still great., They don't make my ears sore anymore.",15
385,I would recommend them highly based on my usage so far.,15
386,"These headphones are wonderful, I can do all those things and more and not have to worry about a cord getting tangled or tying me to my phone.",15
387,"I used them for several hours every day, and only charge them up once a week.",15
388,Also syncing took a great deal of attempts and time to work.,15
389,then you'll be fine.,15
390,Even though I dropped it more times than I can count.,15
391,"The white ones are nice in appearance and I liked the red stripe on the right hand side, which makes knowing which side is which very easy at a glance.",15
392,"When my daughter saw it the first time, she wants it because it matches with her Sony Laptop and now I had to order another one because I need one.",15
393,"When they came in the mail, he was thrilled.",15
394,They work quite well with a Nook HD+ and allow me to move without being entangled in wires when I put the Nook down to do something else.,15
395,"Nice headphones for the money, but the mic and noise canceling is very poor.",15
396,I bought the headphone set for my granddaughter and she was ecstatic!,15
397,I had discovered with the 220s that I had to have my phone in my right front pocket for a steady connection because the receiver for the headphones is in the right side.,15
398,I use it for watching movies on my ipad - not looking for the best quality audio for listening to music.,15
399,The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the band is a little wide and I have a hard time to fit them well to my head.,15
400,They squeeze one's head like a vice.,16
401,I'm totally used to them now.,16
402,I bought two sets of these for my children (ages 4 and 6) to use on an airplane with their kindles.,16
403,The first one was for my child's schools needs.,16
404,These phones are used by a deaf friend of mine so he can listen to audio books.,16
405,Its more about the comfort while using it,16
406,"Even with these nitpicks, I still give these 5/5 stars.",16
407,They are hard plastic with little give.,16
408,It's not like the professional ones but it is great quality for the price and it may just last longer for me than my Behringer ones that only lasted a year and I payed more for!,16
409,"Pros: easy to connect, clear connection, compact

Cons: not tight enough on my ears nor my husband's therefore does not block out much background noise/other music at the gym

Overall, I am disappointed.",16
410,"Now they are probably a little bigger than what you think, but they fit nice around your ears, and provide some noise cancellation because of that.",16
411,"The battery life is ok, I just wish it had a longer battery life.",16
412,The bass was surprisingly strong and the mids and highs were acceptable for phones at this price.,16
413,I purchase the BTH240 and the BTD-400 bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter for my Dell laptop which I had recently converted from WIN7 to Ubuntu Linux 14.04.,16
414,"All other affordable headphones have only lasted me a few months, so, needless to say, I was very pleased with this pair.",16
415,Niceb Bluetooth headphones.,16
416,"They don't bother your ears at all, and they sound great.",16
417,If you don't plan on laying down in these you will not have any problems.,16
418,I love the way it sounds and feels.,16
419,Sound is clear.,16
420,It is very comfortable on the ear as well.,16
421,"I'm still on the fence on if I'll be trying another product from the company or not, because I really did feel it was an exceptional product for the price before the incident.",16
422,All of that compared to same priced motorola device.,16
423,This headset is equal to a much higher priced set.,16
424,Discomfort sets in after a few hours (I've been streaming a lot of Breaking Bad).,16
425,My earbuds are stronger and are more comfortable.,17
426,The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because they drop calls - even when you have a wifi assisted connection.,17
427,"I have never owned a ""behind the neck"" set of headphones.",17
428,"Overall, I highly recommend them for the average listener, but not for the audiophile snob types.",17
429,Sound is Muffled like it needs more power to drive it?,17
430,"I've been using it for a good 4 month to this date by now, and so far I had absolutely no trouble nor any malfunctions.",17
431,"He love the audio books and movies available, and raves about the excellent quality of these earphones to everyone.",17
432,Best headphone I've ever used.,17
433,Do not buy if you have large ears.,17
434,I have bought two sony headphones in my lifetime.,17
435,"They certainly do not compare to Bose in sound quality or comfort, but for the price, the sound quality is quite good and they appear to be reasonably durable.",17
436,Sound quality was moderate.,17
437,"I am purchasing another pair today so I can have a dedicated unit for work, I am confident my old pair will continue to perform for the next year so in my locker they go!",17
438,And it allows me to be able to speak to the little kids without trying to speak above the sounds from his math blasting out from the speakers!,17
439,Super durable I guess.,17
440,"They're definitely not the greatest headphones, but the sound quality IS good for the price.",17
441,"If you actually know anything about sound reproduction, these are great headphones!",17
442,The material appears sturdy enough.,17
443,SO these are comfortable.,17
444,These headphones were exactly what I was looking for.,17
445,"Easy to use, light (in spite of their size), these headphones are really perfect.",17
446,They're super durable.,17
447,These headphones are extremely uncomfortable to use for more than a few minutes at a time.,17
448,I was looking for decent over-the-ear headphones and found these on Amazon.,17
449,Range on the bluetooth is pretty generous before the audio drops.,17
450,"Once your headphones and device are connected, they're basically ready.",18
451,"My only complaint is that they're described as ""noise cancelling"" and they definitely are not.",18
452,Lastly I just want to say that these come with a nice sturdy cord.,18
453,Just a note ...,18
454,He can wear his helmet while riding his bike and still use these to listen to music.,18
455,"Good soun quality for simple video, music and talk hands free.",18
456,"Personally, they are a little big and don't quite fit.",18
457,I would highly recommend these headphones without any reservations.,18
458,If you are looking for legit stereo sound without paying an outrageous amount these are for you.,18
459,They still work as well as they did the day I got them.,18
460,Great for working around the house.,18
461,They do take a bit of getting use to getting them on your ears.,18
462,"They sound great, and function intuitively.",18
463,These are great!,18
464,"It came in the mail quite fast, sounds really good looks really good.",18
465,I'm no audiophile.,18
466,"For the price of this set, I'd give it my approval.",18
467,"It came in the mail quite fast, sounds really good looks really good.",18
468,"Stays securely in place, even on long runs.",18
469,"This is an Awsome wireless BlueTooth headset, especially for the bargain price.",18
470,Cops have showed up at my house to verify if everything is okay.,18
471,Does not look genuine sony product.,18
472,Phone calls sounded great on them and were very clear.,18
473,"Also, while it is lightly sitting on ear, it also isolates the noise pretty well.",18
474,I felt it was a great purchase for this price.,18
475,Efficiency: This just means how loud they go.,19
476,I'm a teacher at a small alternative high school with students who have major behavioral issues.,19
477,"The noise cancellation was much better than I thought it would be, so definite props for that on low price headphones.",19
478,"The handiness of bluetooth combine with how small and lightweight the item is to create the perfect ""jogger's headphones"".",19
479,I haven't tested with any music loaded on my device but will certainly report back if I see any issues there.,19
480,"These headphones are built by amazingly, talented, under-aged Chinese slave children.",19
481,Could be me but I don't find myself to be technologically illiterate and I completed normal troubleshooting procedure.,19
482,The sound is good and acceptable.,19
483,They don't hug my head too tightly (where I might get a headache).,19
484,These headphones... Wow.,19
485,The distance says up to 30ft.,19
486,They must have used a tiny model in the photo.,19
487,"The sound quality is some of the best I have experienced with headphones under $20, you can get a fair bit of bass and easily enough volume to block out the noise around you without blowing out your ears.",19
488,It is annoying enough that I have gone back to a wired set of headphones.,19
489,When i would out on my Treadclimber the sound is great and really gets me going.,19
490,"Call quality is solid, and being able to walk around the office while on a call is wonderful.",19
491,This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I bought 'em because of price and the good ratings.,19
492,"I did that, but the sound quality was still bad.",19
493,I've worn them for over an hour at at stretch and they don't hurt my ears.,19
494,But I can't figure out how to adjust skype on Ubuntu with it.,19
495,I have bought Bluetooth headphones before and they were always poor sounding when bass kicked in.,19
496,"Can go anywhere in my 2 story house, including the basement with good signal from the tablet.",19
497,Very disappointed!!,19
498,"There is some getting used to the controls- volume, pause, bluetooth, etc.",19
499,"Sound is good, far from perfect but what were you expecting for this price?",19
500,"I plan on using this primarily while doing yard work and mowing, so its more liable to get dirty.",20
501,These are some kind of thin synthetic leather-like material with foam inside.,20
502,I purchased this for my wife for Christmas.,20
503,I was so pleased that I purchased three (two black and one white).,20
504,"Things with lots of bass (movies, dance music) have good punch.",20
505,We are happy about the purchase.,20
506,I gave these 5-stars because they exceeded my expectations at any price.,20
507,"They're small and would be a great size for a child, the sound quality is ok, it sounds a bit low and the bass isn't much, it doesn't sound like the 20$ sony headphones, this pair would be a step down from that.",20
508,I would say they look better and they seemed a bit smaller around the head but overall I prefer the SoundBot's in this price range.,20
509,No deep bass like Bose but good dynamic sound & switching to phone calls is seamless.,20
510,I stongly recommend in investing in these headphones.,20
511,The sound is decent and they are pretty sturdy.,20
512,They stay on your head very well when you go running.,20
513,These headphones are bulky and weigh almost twice as much as the S305's.,20
514,"They pair easily, rarely skip even for a second and have a very decent range (25-30 feet).",20
515,"You'll be fine listening to rap and hip-hop, but stuff like dubstep, with alot of bass, would sound bad.",20
516,Super comfy because I don't have to shove a plug into my ear.,20
517,We bought these for our son and they broke within 90 days.,20
518,Had a white pair that's lasted me 4+ years and bought this pair for my boyfriend because his previous pair from Zagg had a cord that broke after one year.,20
519,I am so glad I made this purchase!,20
520,I let people listen and now 3 other people have bought them.,20
521,The second pair came in the mail worked great for a week.,20
522,I bought this pair to replace my Sony MDR-V150 headphones which have deteriorating ear pads.,20
523,Not perfect but what do you want for 30 bucks.,20
524,The sound wouldn't come out after that mishap.,20
525,I love listening to music and these headphones are comfortable...The sound quality is very good.,21
526,the ear piece rotates side ways and long ways.,21
527,"Durable, great quality.",21
528,you are still looking for more pros?,21
529,"Besides, they are comfortable to wear.",21
530,"Cheap feeling, stiff, and basically NO bass whatsoever.",21
531,Bought them as gifts for directors who were competing at a marching band event and they loved them!!!,21
532,"-They stay on perfectly well while I exercise (workouts generally include lots of movement, and LOTS of sweat).",21
533,"It came in the mail quite fast, sounds really good looks really good.",21
534,I was originally impressed at their responsiveness and proposed solution to the problem.,21
535,I'll definitely be buying these again!!,21
536,Works great to talk through as well.,21
537,This is my second pair of kinivo blue tooth headphones.,21
538,They are easy to set up.,21
539,Beats are overrated in my opinion and the quality that Sony offers is top notch and these headphones are a reflection of that.,21
540,The headphones themselves are very light and very comfortable on my head but the bad noise coming from the left speaker is always there.,21
541,"When I saw the picture, I expected a bigger pair of headphones.",21
542,I would recommend either one and will most likey buy myself the Artic based on good base in any position.,21
543,Bluetooth range not great but not a detractor.,21
544,these headphones have very good sound quality for the price.. they are comfortable and hardly weigh anything.. the white color stands out and it looks sweet.,21
545,I got these for my daughter's 12th birthday and she loves them.,21
546,"If its for regular use and just upgrading from stock headphones then go for it, but if your a audiophile and looking for some new bluetooth headphones skip these as you will be disappointed.",21
547,I would not recommend this to a person who plans to wear headphones for more than 45mins per use.,21
548,Bluetooth connectivity sometimes buggy with iphones.,21
549,"A few days later, they responded letting me know that they were sending a whole new set of headphones and that they should be arriving quickly.",21
550,"These ones lasted through running in snow, rain, heat.",22
551,"I wish they had a better grip though, as in a month they started to fall down if I picked something up.",22
552,"Where the Sony's fit the average human head perfectly and securely, the Kinivo's dig into your skull and start hurting after wearing them any longer than a few minutes.",22
553,They only broke when I accidentialy had them in my pocket while kayaking.,22
554,I wanted something that would fold for transport and not have to sacrifice good sound quality.,22
555,These headphones are extremely uncomfortable to use for more than a few minutes at a time.,22
556,This is my second pair of kinivo blue tooth headphones.,22
557,I didn't use them every day maybe 2-3 times a week.,22
558,"Nice headphones for the money, but the mic and noise canceling is very poor.",22
559,The previous set I owned (different brand) lasted for 5 months before they crapped out.,22
560,"Since these are on-ear headphones and are not noise cancelling, they do not really keep outside noise out, especially if you're on a plane or around noisy people.",22
561,The power switch failed mechanically.,22
562,The band is worn in the back of the neck so it's out of the way and you forget they are even there!,22
563,1) There is a loss of sound separation in the mid-ranges.,22
564,"After a time, they do become a bit uncomfortable due to the tighter squeeze than an over the head style of headphones involve.",22
565,"Being a rather critical music listener I bought five different sets of on-ear type headphones to choose among, comparing all of them with the equalizer set to flat across.",22
566,Really Love it Rather Spend 20$ for decent headphones like these than 200$ or more for beats!,22
567,"It's possible I just got a bad pair, but I suggest avoiding these anyway.",22
568,"If you need a pair for only 1 year, these are fine but don't expect to use them for 3 or more years, because they will disintegrate on your head",22
569,"These headphones are all you need, unless you have a uncontrollable urge for paying too much and have to show thee world you can afford paying for a very fancy shipping box.",22
570,Probably the 300 offers a better bass quality.,22
571,Bottom line: The sound is very clear and they are easy to use.,22
572,Overall I wouldnt recommend this product and wish I had bought something else.,22
573,"I have spent the past few months looking for a cheap bluetooth option because when the family is at home, and I'm on the treadmill watching whatever on the TV, I can listen to it without disturbing them.",22
574,They are so convenient for when he is working he can listen to his music and answer phone calls with just one click without having to take out his phone and answer the call or change songs!,22
575,this has been resolved with the 240.  the blue led light has been muted significantly.,23
576,"I've owned a lot of wired headphones, some of which were hi end.",23
577,My main purpose for these are for phone conversations which sound crystal clear.,23
578,These are good for the price.,23
579,"You can feel the weight when you first put it on, depending how you run or work out it could jiggle around but the sound is great, I can hear the base and keep the beat while on the spin bike.",23
580,"It gives a nice sound quality though, it's worth the buy.",23
581,"I like the Kinivo, and I will continue searching for a different BT transmitter that will hopefully pair successfully.",23
582,I'm totally used to them now.,23
583,It cancels surrounding noise very well.,23
584,My teenage son uses them constantly and hasn't had any problems.,23
585,"Range isn't as far as the 220
2.",23
586,"They are not really noise cancelling, but are effective and comfortable.",23
587,The headphones work well and its not too loud.,23
588,"Although I received this item as ""refurbished"", it looks brand new and is in PERFECT working condition.",23
589,She can wear them for hours while she studies without trouble.,23
590,I felt it was a great purchase for this price.,23
591,UPATE: Their customer service notified me after reading this review and sent me a new paid to replace the pair with the power issue.,23
592,But not anymore!,23
593,All of that compared to same priced motorola device.,23
594,"It works great for that, as long is it only used for a short period.",23
595,The poorly designed bass response was also taken into consideration.,23
596,"It could be made comfortable if it were adjustable, but it isn't.",23
597,It was delivered on time and came in good condition so I'm overall okay with it.,23
598,I'm using it right now and have been the last 4 hours... still no feed me beep and I still haven't charged it....it's awesome.,23
599,This item was delivered promptly and as agreed on.,23
600,"So they are wireless and you can answer phone calls with them, what's better than that.",24
601,I would not buy it again.,24
602,"These work really well (not perfect) with my iPhone 5, MapMyFitness, and my Fitletic Race Belt.",24
603,Batteries last ~12 hours of playback and as it turns out they work great for phone calls as well - bonus!,24
604,"The MDR-ZX100 easily slips off your head, doesn't adjust tightly and sounds very low, no matter how high you turn your volume up.",24
605,"Paired quickly and stays connected consistently, with good range.",24
606,"Eventually, after falling to the ground and two years of general abuse they started to fail.",24
607,"I had a pair of Koniva bth220, (which is an awesome pair) of bt headphones but they got ran over.",24
608,Been using it like 6 or 7 hours while I jog and no problem so far.,24
609,So buy New from another seller.,24
610,I like how they came with a travel pouch/ bag.,24
611,"They compress my ears too much, and the band presses against my skull behind my ears to the point that I can only wear them for an hour or two before I have to take them off for a while to let my head decompress.",24
612,"I had just lost some pretty good headphones, but I wasn't really interested in an investment.",24
613,"I don't give 5 stars lightly, but this is about as good a deal as I've seen on headphones in a long time.",24
614,As a result music lacks clarity that you'll find in higher quality headphones.,24
615,Highly recommended!,24
616,You won't regret it!,24
617,I ordered it about a month ago agony I still don't need to charge it!,24
618,I liked the price so I took a chance.,24
619,Received these for my 5 year old son.,24
620,The only ones where 1. the don't hurt my ears 2.,24
621,I wear these at work.,24
622,The price is certainly right.,24
623,Definitely a bargain.,24
624,Just make sure you don't push it and you'll be fine.,24
625,"Occasionally there is an odd distortion when connected to my computer, but a quick disconnect and reconnect fixes it.",25
626,One hand operation.,25
627,another thing i am a hardcore music lisitner  usually me ears start to buzz when im throu the first 4 hors but with these i could last 8 hors then i had to take them off for 30 min,25
628,It is like they were made for kids?,25
629,I love them I'm gonna personalize them with jewels and things later this week because they look blah just being so white but that's just me.,25
630,"I decided that I wanted to try a bluetooth option for my daily workouts... Let me tell you, I will not miss my annoying earbuds or the cord!",25
631,This is certainly the case here as well.,25
632,I use these pretty regularly and have had them for about a year.,25
633,Loose the wires!,25
634,Would buy again.,25
635,These work just as well.,25
636,Love this headset.,25
637,"If the comfort were improved so I didn't have it hurting my ears, I would have no hesitation recommending it to others.",25
638,cord is pretty thick for headphones in the price level and good strain relief near the ends that hopefully will give long and trouble free use.,25
639,Sound quallity is not great unless eq'd - too little bass and treble.,25
640,"Haven't really tested out the battery life or durability yet, but I suspect they will be more than sufficient.",25
641,"Even if these broke, I would probably invest in a second pair.",25
642,"It is pretty hard to press, making it difficult to turn and off and making it easy to give the wrong command.",25
643,"There is a soft feel to these headphones that integrate with the body, on the head and too in perception of sound that just feels natural, ergonomic in the highest sense of that term, again in relation to the price.",25
644,This headset remembers pairing with up to 5 devices.,25
645,Wondering how long before it breaks but I'm guessing it will really last...hahaha.,25
646,Exactly what I expected from a low priced Sony headset.,25
647,"They're very comfortable, even after wearing them for extended periods of time.",25
648,The price makes this product even better.,25
649,"I'm pleased with the battery life, and charging them up is simple with any standard micro-USB charger.",25
650,the sound is amazing quality is good and i loved the price you cant beat under 20 for sony headphones.,26
651,You will not get any appreciably better audio quality with more expensive headphones like Beats for 100s of dollars more.,26
652,"After a lot of comparison and online soul searching, Kinivo was my choice, as far as price, sound, and comfort it gets 5 stars.",26
653,"I decided that I wanted to try a bluetooth option for my daily workouts... Let me tell you, I will not miss my annoying earbuds or the cord!",26
654,Be mindful of this if you have a bigger head.,26
655,"I didn't expect that much from them, but when my son (who is 8) started to rave about how awesome they are I had to try them out.",26
656,I bought my daughter a pair for Christmas because I liked the color.,26
657,I was look for an adjustment to decrease or increase the length of the neck band.,26
658,Had a white pair that's lasted me 4+ years and bought this pair for my boyfriend because his previous pair from Zagg had a cord that broke after one year.,26
659,Normally cheap headphones are tinny and junky sounding but these really sound good.,26
660,"Sony did a great job on these...would buy another pair,for the price...you can't go wrong...",26
661,other than that they hold a long charge.,26
662,"These headphone look stylish, contour to my head well, and sound great!!",26
663,After owning these for several days now I could not be more pleased.,26
664,I was so excited to try these out considering all the positive reviews.,26
665,"So when these were on sale, I figured why not try them.",26
666,"If you wear a larger hat size, these headphones are probably not for you.",26
667,The sound quality is very good and has good strong bass.,26
668,I listen to a lot of audio books and love these ear phones for than.,26
669,"On the calls I've tried, it works just fine.",26
670,These have about the same quality as Apple earbuds.,26
671,"All in all, I would highly recommend these headphones and have recommended them to friends on several occasions.",26
672,"They worked fine before, but I have to say I'm very disappointed.",26
673,They work great when placing phone calls as well.,26
674,Great for the price and I will likely purchase them again when my son loses or breaks these.,26
675,These were perfect for that purpose!,27
676,I enjoyed very much this pair of headphones.,27
677,If you wear these headphones for to long they will make your ears red and sweaty plus really soar.,27
678,"Only three stars because these feel even cheaper, and fit worse than a pair I received for free for promotional purposes, with a hospital's name on them.",27
679,"I owned a similar pair of Sony headphones about ten years ago, and for the price there is no better pair that you can get.",27
680,These are also very sturdy.,27
681,Each charge gives about 2 days worth of listening.,27
682,Does not look genuine sony product.,27
683,"I'm a trained audio engineer, but I get that these are cheap-o headphones.",27
684,Overall decent for the price and for the style which seems to be somewhat rare.,27
685,I can now use my phone charger instead of having to locate my old phone charger and have two chargers.,27
686,I usually don't have any issues with these headphones.,27
687,"The padding rests on your ear instead of around it like other, larger headphones.",27
688,"Since these are not in ear, when you put the volume pretty loud, other people can hear your music.",27
689,"I wasn't about to pay $200 for a pair of Beats for her, these look nice, and work very well for the price.",27
690,"good for rock and hip hop, pop music.",27
691,"I find myself having to use the Small Speakers equalizer on my iPod to tame the treble, which I never have to do with MDR-V150s.",27
692,My only 'con' would be length of the cable.,27
693,One of the earbuds had broken making it necessary to purchase another set.,27
694,I can also attest that in the winter they actually keep your ears warm!,27
695,You don't have to go through that process every time.,27
696,We use the new set for audio and phone calls only.,27
697,I did sink it to my phone and it was great.,27
698,"They do get a little uncomfortable after extended wearing, but it's not a deal breaker.",27
699,My earbuds are stronger and are more comfortable.,27
700,"I listen to a lot of different styles of music, from alt.",28
701,The other loses connection often as it tries to connect to every device at once.,28
702,"I checked my orders and it literally had the little ""(White)"" in the name.",28
703,In fact just yesterday was the first time that it didn't but that was related to the adapter not the headphone.,28
704,I bought some headphones thinking they had Base either than that there good headphones but no Base :( I would recommend this for who ever like headphones with Low Base :),28
705,"I have been looking everywhere for the right pair of workout headphones, and these are it!",28
706,I've had problems with it pairing at all with other bluetooth speakers.,28
707,The video here is a video from my channel on YouTube -- ONOTech.,28
708,These will be my second set of this model Sony headphone.,28
709,I am a truck driver that drives a 90's Ford truck with lots of noise.,28
710,It was bound to happen one day but I was expecting a longer life time from the rest of these reviews.,28
711,"I don't use it for phone calls much; it's not ideal for calls, but it works.",28
712,The left speaker blew out after about two months of use.,28
713,Overall I'd recommend it.,28
714,Looks like a very expensive pair of headphones and has good sound.,28
715,I have not had this frustrating experience with any other bluetooth headphones on the same devices.,28
716,They could even add $2 to the price without ruining the great value of them.,28
717,Light weight and good sound quality (it's no Bose but decent for the price).,28
718,I liked the price so I took a chance.,28
719,They're better than the Skullcandy 2XL's that I was replacing like Pez ... when I can hear them.,28
720,They sound great and the Bluetooth connection rarely cuts out.,28
721,The over-the-ear design works great -- they stay firmly attached even when I am moving about.,28
722,What is there NOT to like??,28
723,I'm surprised at how clear and easy they are to use.,28
724,"Long range, good sound, decent battery.",28
725,"You can feel the weight when you first put it on, depending how you run or work out it could jiggle around but the sound is great, I can hear the base and keep the beat while on the spin bike.",29
726,They bluetooth well and do just what they say.,29
727,I wanted to replace the USB Microsoft LifeChat I use with Bluetooth headphones.,29
728,They felt very expensive on my ears!,29
729,"These work really well (not perfect) with my iPhone 5, MapMyFitness, and my Fitletic Race Belt.",29
730,"good for rock and hip hop, pop music.",29
731,"The sound is surprisingly good, the padding is comfortable, and they don't cost much.",29

733,If you have a lot of music on your cell phone you will enjoy this headset.they are very comfortable to wearand the batteries last all day.,29
734,Pairing them with my cell phone and my computer haven't been a problem.,29
735,"For the price, the sounds is awesome and really makes you feel you are right in either the concert or movie theater!",29
736,"I checked my orders and it literally had the little ""(White)"" in the name.",29
737,The headphones arrived quickly and worked well.,29
738,I've had a pair of these (white) for three years and they are still going strong.,29
739,I've carried them in my Targus messenger bag for the past couple of months with ease.,29
740,Disclosure: Kinivo provided me the Kinivo BTH240.,29
741,Those could break easily.,29
742,"This worked fine, but I did replace it with an $80 Logitech.",29
743,The earbuds are heavily padded and soft as well.,29
744,"If you are looking for a sport headphone, get Sony mdr-g45lp, it doesn't have bluetooth but at least it is lighter and cheaper and doesn't hurt.",29
745,Body is excellent.,29
746,"Normally I'm not one to write negative reviews, but yikes, I'm pretty dissatisfied with these headphones, even for the $20 I paid.",29
747,"I love balanced clean sound, but I'm also a child of the 80's... so I like bass I can feel.",29
748,"I don't give 5 stars lightly, but this is about as good a deal as I've seen on headphones in a long time.",29
749,The sound quality is good.,29
750,"i wanna know if it's possible that if i send this back and they can give me a refund, or give me one that works.",30
751,"All in all, they are priced cheap, but you get a ton of bang for your buck in terms of quality.",30
752,"Iron Maiden, Reel Big Fish, and The Smashing Pumpkins all sound horrid and bland on these.",30
753,"Plus, a friend of mine called while I was running so it had clear sound and she was able to hear me clearly.",30
754,(Did I even spell bear right?,30
755,You have to add this to your collection.,30
756,They come with a micro usb charging cable and a velvet-like pouch for storage.,30
757,Replaced another pair which did not hold a charge for more than two hours.,30
758,"The headphones are light, featuring a nice, thick cable.",30
759,paired with my iphone5 - they aren't loud enough for my type of use ( mountain bike riding - working out- running) .,30
760,Will update this review to let you know what I think.,30
761,I have to say I am very impressed!,30
762,Couldn't ask for anything better!,30
763,"So, if you need a pair of ""Headphones"" but you ""Ain't got a lot of money"", then check these out!!",30
764,The last time I bought a pair of nice Sony headphones they cost about $60 for the same quality.,30
765,The cheap Sony brand works just fine.,30
766,These were perfect for that purpose!,30
767,Can take a beating from my 5 year old and my 6 year old.,30
768,I would definitely recommend these to those who don't want to spend too much but still get good sound in return.,30
769,"Not expensive, but not cheap.",30
770,I thank the many other users for the great reviews that brought me to this purchase.,30
771,I usually don't have any issues with these headphones.,30
772,Kids can be turds.,30
773,They have been great!,30
774,I bought these for 29 dollars and they beat out headsets that have an msrp of three times the price.,30
775,The sound wouldn't come out after that mishap.,31
776,Sound escapes it - terrible for discreet listening/listening to something loud in quiet places.,31
777,"I have awkward sized ears, so most in-ear earbuds don't fit me or cause pain when I try to use them.",31
778,The headset works as advertised.,31
779,I looked at several different makes and models and decided to try these.,31
780,"It should be noted that they can be had from Best Buy for $20 with free shipping, rather than the $40 amazon is at right now.",31
781,I can leave my phone on the kitchen counter and still stay connected in the basement or upstairs.,31
782,The latest versions allow you to connect to multiple devices simultaneously.,31
783,they would be fine.,31
784,"I use them on my bike trainer so I can watch TV without having to turn the volume up to 100, and I don't have to adjust them every 5 seconds.",31
785,The buttons on the side feel a little cheap but it's tolerable.,31
786,Cannot get the headphones to pair with any bluetooth items.,31
787,"For the price you cannot do any better on Amazon, believe me I've checked.",31
788,I can't use them if I am trying to work on stuff beside my computer.,31
789,"They are comfortable and deliver great sound, but the cord is a smidge short and doesn't allow much freedom of movement.",31
790,These are great for any  music of mine!,31
791,***The huge downfall to these headphones is there is NO OVERHEAD CUSION.,31
792,Sound escapes it - terrible for discreet listening/listening to something loud in quiet places.,31
793,"They really are ""good enough"" and honestly better than anything else you'll find for under $40.",31
794,"A great value, too.",31
795,I assume the headset's connecting wire  is supposed to ride along the back side of the neck or head.,31
796,It's not very comfortable either.,31
797,Very good volume.,31
798,Now I just recieved the BTH240 and it is 2.1+EDR same as the older version.,31
799,I recommend highly that you buy a pair!,31
800,I broke the first pair in one ear because I pulled the cord hard so I got another pair and they are holding up well.,32
801,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,32
802,I found out that after a couple of months of use one of the headphone does not work anymore.,32
803,Very light and folds up for travel.,32
804,He said the sound was great compared to most sets he's had.,32
805,"There is no tone definition, very muddy sounding.",32
806,"back on they go...she is disabled so i,m glad to have  something of good quality that she gets so much joy from,  and at a reasonable price,  thanks again.",32
807,"I know most people are thinking ""why are you excited about something it's supposed to do"" but believe me, I've had many others that didn't.",32
808,These headsets are awesome.,32
809,I'm by no means an audiophile.,32
810,They are not as comfortable on my head as the old Motorola they are replacing after 6 years but they also cost less than 1/2 of the old unit.,32
811,"Call quality is even exceptional, though I try not to use them for that purpose, as I tend to talk a magnitude or two louder when I use them.",32
812,I like them better than beats.,32
813,"They are comfortable, block out outside noise, and have good audio quality.",32
814,Battery life is good.,32
815,These headphones are hard to beat for the price.,32
816,and the sound is EXCELLENT!!!,32
817,"By the way, the sound quality is very nice.",32
818,They are perfect for the gym.,32
819,"When I watch shows on my computer, the sound is much more ""well rounded"" and accurate than when I play it through my computer speakers.",32
820,"In hindsight, I should have stepped up the extra $13 and purchased the Koss R10.",32
821,These are fine.,32
822,I bought mine almost two years ago for twenty bucks and it still works so well.,32
823,Only think I wish it did was fold up for compatibility... Other than that I'm a satisfied mommy!,32
824,They were and they sent me a pair as well.,32
825,These are probably my biggest complaint with the device.,33
826,One charge lasts basically all day.,33
827,"I wanted to see how low impedance headphones would work with this amplifier, whether I would hear any hiss or hum with such low impedance headphones, and the amplifier passed with flying colors.",33
828,I bought the headphone set for my granddaughter and she was ecstatic!,33
829,Can't beat the price and quality!,33
830,The sound quality is very good and has good strong bass.,33
831,"Very satisfied with this product and performance - Light weight, comfortable padding for long use, long lasting battery and relatively inexpensive compared to other similar products.",33
832,My daughter is using them with her iPad and is very happy.,33
833,"i don't like it , because the cable is short , and it's not comfortable :( , a like the sound quality and weight , i shouldn't forget the price , for the price i think it's a nice choice .",33
834,The last time I bought a pair of nice Sony headphones they cost about $60 for the same quality.,33
835,"Got what I wanted, nuff said.",33
836,They are awesome!,33
837,Just got these a couple days ago and I'm very pleased.,33
838,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,33
839,I also wanted wireless because I didn't want to be tied to my iPad - I wanted to be able to move around and do things while listening.,33
840,My daughter loves them.,33
841,"Aside from that minor point, I am thoroughly delighted with my Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones.",33
842,No issues here.,33
843,Very much worth the money.,33
844,"Appear a bit cheaply made, I think the all-black selection may look better than this red/black color, but it isn't horrible - not garish.",33
845,"The white is nice and the red is a cute touch, I get a lot of compliments on these.",33
846,I am using them with my Nexus 5 and Macbook to listen to music.,33
847,"All in all it is worth buying I recommend doing so for music,phone calls, and Skype or other online chat.",33
848,"Comfortable, and a long enough line.",33
849,"I'm partial to over-the-ear headphones, never could get used to uncomfortable earbuds.",33
850,I had to call Apple and they were able to help me pair it.,34
851,"They never break on the band, so they are sturdy...though I do take great care with my headphones as much as possible.",34
852,I'm not sure if I'm crazy or not but it makes sense as the right ear is the one with all the controls.,34
853,I bought these after years of wanting a pair of Bluetooth headphones and I am glad I did.,34
854,If I wear them longer than 4 hours they start to get uncomfortable because the plastic band is a bit thicker than other models so they start to irritate the back of my ear but in a way that is a good thing because they seem pretty darn sturdy.,34
855,This headphones are unbeatable for this price.,34
856,"For 5 dollars more, the Sony MDR-V150 headphones are WAY better.",34
857,The first set had the speaks go out and the same thing happened to the second set.,34
858,Would rather buy it for $10 instead of $15.,34
859,These are fairly terrible.,34
860,"I'm sure they'll be put to good use, but if you get too rowdy @ the ""Ponder the Mystery Party"", Baby these  are comin' out!",34
861,Range a little challenging sometimes.,34
862,You would be disappointed.,34
863,"And finally, a curious statement printed on the back of the package: ""If you use the headphones with WALKMAN that has a noise canceling function, the noise canceling function will not work.""",34
864,"and as much as I love Amazon, I don't love over paying if I don't have too.",34
865,I was mad but when I put on the head phones I was very happy!,34
866,"After all they've been through, they are still working in perfect condition.",34
867,All in all I highly recommend.,34
868,"It also works if your phone is left in the car while you get gas, etc.",34
869,"You can feel the weight when you first put it on, depending how you run or work out it could jiggle around but the sound is great, I can hear the base and keep the beat while on the spin bike.",34
870,They also have more volume than these kinda hollow tinny sounding ZX100s.,34
871,"I've had these headphones for less than six months and now the left side has blown out, for $25 I kind of expected more.",34
872,They are also very easily adjusted and can be changed around to fit your individual measurement.,34
873,The battery life is amazing after all this time I still get a full 8 hours of talk time.,34
874,"I'm sure they'll be put to good use, but if you get too rowdy @ the ""Ponder the Mystery Party"", Baby these  are comin' out!",34
875,I don't know if I should get these or the new ones...,35
876,Will be picking up a second set for myself so I can listen to some tunes at the office.,35
877,Money well spent!,35
878,We've gone through a couple of pair but that's due more to misuse on her part.,35
879,"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.",35
880,I enjoyed very much this pair of headphones.,35
881,Great for the average ipod music lover or for watching movies on the ipad!!!,35
882,"I bought these for my dear hubby, at his request.. No personal experience, just his word.",35
883,"I checked my orders and it literally had the little ""(White)"" in the name.",35
884,They worked great and lasted at least a year.,35
885,"If its for regular use and just upgrading from stock headphones then go for it, but if your a audiophile and looking for some new bluetooth headphones skip these as you will be disappointed.",35
886,"Easy to wear (not uncomfortable), stay on my ears when i need them to, not much else to say.",35
887,so we got another 2 pairs one for each kid and in different colors.,35
888,Very good stereo sound.,35
889,"Also keep in mind, because these are behind the ear headphones, if you are leaning back against something, like sitting up in bed or laying down on a pillow, this kind of pushes them forward.",35
890,"Before I even downloaded all my songs to the new MP3 I purchased from Amazon at the same time as these groovy headphones, one of the earpieces fell into a vodker and soda...soaked to schmitt.",35
891,Turned out to be a Win-Win!,35
892,Definitely recommend!,35
893,"They are cheap, but there are many -- MANY other cheap headphones that are much better than these.",35
894,So far (after 4 workouts) they have not let me down.,35
895,I love having buttons on the side so I don't need to be next to my phone.,35
896,The sound is okay but they are quite uncomfortable to wear.,35

955,I can connect even during a call.,38
956,"these are nice, the bluetooth connection and not having to use a wire is nice, but these weren't loud enough for me, I used these in the gym the first day and it didn't block out all the gym noises like with my regular apple ear pods",38
957,An hour or so and that's all I can take.,38
958,It is way worse with the Watch.,38
959,"I was looking for a BT Headset without a boom mic, similar to my Motorola S305 which is incredibly quirky with Win7.",38
960,"I originally got these headphones in black a few years back with my Zune and only after getting stepped on, did they break.",38

976,Headphones fit my head.,39
977,I kept getting the cord of the cable wrapped around my chair or hooked on something.,39
978,"Fortunately, someone at Motorola must have foreseen this and engineered these rings that snap off of the earphone, allowing you to wrap the foam over them, and clip them right back on; amazingly increasing longevity.",39
979,"Since these headphones are placed on the back of neck, it is hard to tell you whether they are going to fit you.",39
980,I'm sure this plastic would snap if you twisted these too firmly or stepped on them too hard.,39

1182,"The headphones themselves are hard to keep attached to the ears, at least mine, falling off frequently with light movement.",47
1183,"Got these headphones based on a review in a magazine, and it was spot on.",47
1184,Great for working around the house.,47
1185,The distance you can go is pretty good.,47
1186,I like the way you can easily fold them to make them fit in your backpack or in a pouch for protection.,47
1187,These are just what I wanted.,47
1188,they make my head look rounder because they are a bit wide but the sound quality is great!,47
1189,"He says the sound is far superior in these than what we have in the bedroom, which at the time of purchase was the gold standard of wireless headphones.",47
1190,I guess since they cover the ears they really block out a decent amount of outside noise leaving just music.,47
1191,They also got pressed into service as my primary headphones.,47
1192,"However, AMAZON returned for me hassle free.",47
1193,"Decent pair of headphones, especially when you consider the price.",47
1194,"Sounds beautifully, but the cord is just too short.",47
1195,I do occasionally get static when I'm downtown as if a stronger signal just temporarily overwhelmed my bluetooth connection and I have to back up 30 seconds on my audiobook to hear what I missed.,47
1196,"so i can move around my room, untethered, and run to the bathroom or whatever, but i can't set music to play and then wander around the whole house.",47
1197,I was still using my sony earbuds when I ordered these and I am definitely sticking to the brand now.,47
1198,"I've only used them for a day, but so far they are making a good impression.",47
1199,"And how the headphones fold up come in handy when on trips, to give me more room for other things.",47
1200,"The last pair lasted two weeks, but that was partly due to his best friend.",48
1201,We are talking here about a $25 Headphone.,48
1202,"I was looking for a BT Headset without a boom mic, similar to my Motorola S305 which is incredibly quirky with Win7.",48
1203,Mids and highs are very clear and crisp.,48
1204,"I have only had this for about a week and have not used it for music, so I cant speak to that.",48
1205,They are very nice.,48
1206,Bought these for quiet netflix watching and song listening on my chrome book and these definitely do the trick.,48
1207,"Also, the - well, I don't know the name for it, but the thing that connects the two ear-phones, can contact the back of my neck when I look up, which also moves the unit a bit.",48
1208,"Bottom line was that they provided very good sound quality and fit well on everyone's head, from my giant noggin down to my then-preschooler.",48
1209,"For the price I paid, I'm happy with the quality.",48
1210,One extra star because of the reasonable price.,48
1211,"i also haven't been very gentle with them, so i tend to take them off by sliding them off one ear and kinda yanking them off the other in one swift motion...and the frame hasn't twisted or bent in any way.",48
1212,Something I cannot do with a couple of other headphones I own that have oval shaped cushions (i.e.,48
1213,"As for ambient sounds, when you are wearing them, they are a bit muffled, but not blocked.",48
1214,Great bass sound.,48
1215,"They are very light weight, they fold for easy carrying in the bag that was provided and the sound is excellent.",48
1216,They even fold up to stow away in my cargo shorts.,48
1217,They just apologize and send another.,48
1218,The only complaint I have is the cord.,48
1219,"I am going to look into investing in another brand, ANY OTHER BRAND.",48
1220,I recommend these most highly.,48
1221,You def can hear a wide range of sounds.,48
1222,"The headphones are nice, as displayed... what i didn't love is the foam, i expected it to be somehow better; then that the power button of the headphones is easily misoperated, as i took the headphones in my pocket they powered up accidentally.",48
1223,8.5/10 - Bass heavy and get uncomfortable,48
1224,"When still, it works flawlessly.",48

1229,I purchased these headphone exclusively for listening to movies via my Roku 3 Remote Controller which has an Stereo Audio Output Jack for private listening.,49
1230,I wish their quality control was better.,49
1231,"Also the band sticks out from the back of my neck by about 1/2 "" so i can sit on a chair without the headphones getting pushed off my head.",49
1232,"If you're looking for a affordable and good quality headphone, I will recommend these headphones.",49
1233,Turned out to be a Win-Win!,49
1234,"The customer service for this product is outstanding and do the right job to get the job
done in time.",49
1235,It's really good on its cheap price.,49
1236,I bought these because my cat was chewing the cords on my expensive in-ear noise-cancelling earphones.,49
1237,"I thought she was old enough for this style rather than just ear buds, and for the cost of a modest set of buds, these are really good-sounding, well-designed headphones.",49
1238,"Only $25 bucks so we can expect the world, but a solid $25 investment.",49
1239,Might have been expecting a little too much from Sony for the cost.,49
1240,I am seriously amazed at how good these sound.,49
1241,I can't believe how small this headset really is.,49
1242,*Comfortable Secure Fit.,49
1243,The sound-quality when wearing them is clear and even works with bass-heavy* songs.,49
1244,"Being a rather critical music listener I bought five different sets of on-ear type headphones to choose among, comparing all of them with the equalizer set to flat across.",49
1245,"Daughter's gave out a week ago, so they lasted about 8 months.",49
1246,"The ear pads are super soft, and if you're planning on leaving them on your desk all the time, they will be everything you need.",49
1247,"Then one day when I was trying to charge it, the red light turned on for 30 seconds or so and turned off right away.",49
1248,"PROS: Perfect for any mp3 player, tablet, audio device, and computer using a 3.5mm audio jack (virtually all mainstream devices do).",49
1249,"This is a wonderful product for me, as I where hearing aids and can't wear in-the-ear bluetooth.",49
1250,"But as they are, I cannot recommend them.",50
1251,Am very happy with this purchase.,50
1252,"Overall they are, for lack of a better term, balanced.",50
1253,Fantastic value.,50
1254,And there was no way to adjust them so they would stay.,50
1255,You would be disappointed.,50
1256,"The earlier pairs I had were decent, they'd last about 6 months then just stop working.",50
1257,They came in great condition I really like them.,50
1258,I did sink it to my phone and it was great.,50
1259,"While I haven't used a measuring tape, I can easily walk around my entire fitness facility and never lose connection.",50
1260,I'm thinking there is a way to push a button or something to access the phone (Siri) but I have pressed all the buttons and still haven't been successful.,50
1261,Hold down the center button on the right ear pod until the LED flashes red and blue.,50
1262,The headphone's quality of sound is so great that I recommended this to my friend.,50
1263,The Artic seems better on the bass range.,50

1265,"I purchased these headphones to use at our home computer for listening to videos, cds, and u-tube.",50
1266,I'm in love with these things.,50
1267,I'm not concerned about them falling off.,50
1268,"The connector is 90 degrees, so if you're looking for a straight connector, this won't do.",50
1269,They fit well on the ears.,50
1270,I must say my head is all of 71/2 in.,50
1271,I didn't expect that it will come earlier than I expected.,50
1272,"Thought about Motorola, but went with Kinivo.",50
1273,They are definitely not tight around the head/ear but kind of feels like it's hanging down from my ear.,50
1274,"I don't like ear buds, so wearing only over the ear headphones is the only way I can enjoy private audio experiences.",50
1275,The headband is way too rigid and totally uncomfortable.,51
1276,"First of all, the way these fold up makes them relatively easy to carry around, but they are still bulky, and prone to folding out again accidentally.",51
1277,I may need a little pocket charging unit on long outings.,51
1278,"Unfortunately, due to a terrible ear infection, I'm not supposed to be putting anything in my ears (including earbuds) for a very long time, if ever.",51
1279,"maybe i'm crazy, but for $20 these sound 95% as good as anything else out there.",51
1280,"This worked fine, but I did replace it with an $80 Logitech.",51
1281,The Amazon product page lists them as circumaural.,51
1282,"I use both BOSE at home, and this product when I travel.",51
1283,I'd recommend these to anyone looking to get high quality without breaking the bank.,51
1284,They swivel so that it can lay 'flat' but do not 'fold' up into a tidy little bundle as do my Wonderful Air-Fi's (I'm spoiled).,51
1285,I was a bit disappointed I had a pair of the MDRZX100 and wanted another pair since my first messed up.,51
1286,"Sound is good, far from perfect but what were you expecting for this price?",51
1287,Definitely recommend!,51
1288,Highly recommended for anyone who wants something good that will last.,51
1289,I like the overall rating of this headphone.,51
1290,Very decent headphones for the price!,51
1291,Highly recommended.,51
1292,"Even worse, it's terribly uncomfortable to wear.",51
1293,I also have had and used similar type headsets like the Rocketfish RF-MAB2.,51
1294,I was also very surprised at how comfortable they are.,51
1295,"I have an older version of these headphones at home that still work well, but wanted another set for work.",51
1296,The pause works great.,51
1297,"It's also a fairly long cord, so I can just keep my MP3 player in a pocket on my shorts and it's long enough that it won't tug on my head .",51
1298,Turns out they are uncomfortable for me.,51
1299,The music sounds very clear and the sound quality is great.,51
1300,"And occasionally if my phone is buried deep in a pocket or a bag, it can be spotty with the bluetooth.",52
1301,The headphones looked nice but no matter what I tried I could not get sound in both right and left sides.,52
1302,Mid range and bass sound flabby and out of shape causing the highs to sound choppy.,52
1303,Hold down the center button on the right ear pod until the LED flashes red and blue.,52
1304,"I wanted a set that was comfortable, since they can be on for hours and also noise reduction.",52
1305,"Overall, I would recommend these to anyone and if these ever break, I will be back for another pair.",52
1306,Only and minor complaint is that the plastic band stretches .,52
1307,This means there's some degree of noise insulation.,52
1308,Both are built almost identical quality wise.,52
1309,"But again, it lacks the hardshell protection from heavier objects.",52
1310,"But, with the price set on this level!",52
1311,"Takes a bit to adjust to control location(skipped a few songs,dropped a few calls,but great product for the price",52
1312,They are fine for everyday listening.,52
1313,Gave them to my husband hoping his larger head will stretch them out for me :),52
1314,"2.  not a huge problem, but the 240's are thinner than the 220's by a good margin.",52
1315,"A few days later, they responded letting me know that they were sending a whole new set of headphones and that they should be arriving quickly.",52
1316,"So, my solution was to get wireless headphones.",52
1317,Easily heard by people around you.,52
1318,These headphones are bulky and weigh almost twice as much as the S305's.,52
1319,"For the price, I don't think that these 'phones can be beat.",52
1320,They stay put without issue.,52
1321,"I tried other brands and they were okay, but ultimately proved to either be a bit uncomfortable (too rigid) or the speakers would get damaged with the least amount of moisture (sweat).",52
1322,I have the Hopper from Dish and just had to program them in and now I can listened to the music or my shows all over the house...lol I am spoiled and the tone is absolutely wonderful!,52
1323,this does not have that problem.,52
1324,They Sound clear and loud.,52
1325,These sound good and they don't distort when I set a high volume.,53
1326,The biggest pro so far is that they are quite comfortable.,53
1327,They look great and connect easily.,53
1328,"Second, they were packaged well and arrived with no damage.",53
1329,Calling them something you would give to someone you don't see often.,53
1330,The first pair are about 2 years old and still going strong.,53
1331,I felt they were going to fall off at any moment.,53
1332,A great purchase!!!!,53
1333,"Best pair of headphones I have ever owned, and for that price they're a steal!",53
1334,"Please do yourself a favor and grab a pair of these, you won't regret it.",53
1335,They work pretty good.,53
1336,Just want I needed.,53
1337,"For around $20, the sound quality is excellent, and would certainly recommend these to anyone looking for a VERY GOOD set of headphones, that just happen to be inexpensive.",53
1338,Exactly what I expected from a low priced Sony headset.,53
1339,They fit my grand-daughter's head perfect so they can listen to television without disturbing others.,53
1340,"Overview: These Sony Stereo Headphones don't have any sound quality, comfort, or build quality (everything you want in headphones), but they are cheap.",53
1341,"The sound is great in these things and they're not very expensive, either.",53
1342,"I am writing this after a couple of years of ownership, and I haven't used them for a long time, but I dug them out and tried them again.",53
1343,"I don't know if something in the vicinity interferes with the connection or what, but I think the convenience of having a bluetooth headset outweighs the few hickups every now and then.",53
1344,"I ordered these headphones for my son, 17 years old, a wrestler.",53
1345,"Choose to go forward or backward , answer your phone, recall the last number.",53
1346,I also use these headphones when I'm on the computer; I've watched a few interviews online and it's interesting what background noises these headphones pick up.,53
1347,I bought these to play music for our baby while she's in the womb.,53
1348,They replaced a large pair of highly rated Photive over the ear Bluetooth phones (which broke) at half the price.,53
1349,Such a basic headset and the wire connections get loose?,53
1350,"So all the similarities are there, someone said the size of these protruding are smaller than others but i found them to be the same.",54
1351,"I heart radio sounds good on it for the price of the headphones, don't have to give my phone to my wife anymore to watch incoming calls due to the in coming call feature.",54
1352,Really happy with this purchase.,54
1353,"Maybe these aren't perfectly audiophile but it would be hard to touch this quality without spending a whole, whole lot more.",54
1354,These went back.,54
1355,Happy with the price point and glad I purchased them.,54
1356,"If you have a head larger than a 5 year old kid, buy something else!!!",54
1357,They fit comfortably and I use them at work in the office.,54
1358,I also really like the buttons on the side for adjusting the volume; they're perfect for when you're listening to music away from your computer.,54
1359,There was a lack of bass compared to my Sony MDR-XB500's.,54
1360,As far as I can tell awesome product.,54
1361,The fit is not quite as comfortable as some I've tried.,54
1362,I have had them for a few months.,54
1363,Worth the money.,54
1364,Highly recommend to those who have budget around 15-20 bucks.,54
1365,These head phone are still over the ear.,54
1366,"The ear padding is very soft, and the headphones stay secure to your head without pressing in on your ears (which I find uncomfortable over long periods).",54
1367,I am really hoping that the plastic band will stretch a little over time to make them looser.,54
1368,Much better than the Photive and low end Sony phones in my house.,54
1369,Calls are loud and clear and the microphone appears to be really good since everybody says they hear me clearly.,54
1370,"First of all, the way these fold up makes them relatively easy to carry around, but they are still bulky, and prone to folding out again accidentally.",54
1371,Good quality stereo headphones and very attractively priced!,54
1372,People mistook them for Beats headphones at first.,54
1373,I have them on now as I write this review.,54
1374,I hope these never stop being manufactured because I love them!,54
1375,"These headphones are all you need, unless you have a uncontrollable urge for paying too much and have to show thee world you can afford paying for a very fancy shipping box.",55
1376,Only complaint - and it's a minor one - is that they pinch my glasses into my head behind the ears and it's kind of uncomfortable.,55
1377,EDIT: cheap fix for more comfortable headphones is to tuck 1~2 stretched cotton balls into the pads.,55
1378,The Sony seems pretty solid though.,55
1379,I bought these to replace a pair of soundbot bluetooth headphones I purchased about 10 months previously.,55
1380,Loud enough to hear over the mower and long enough to last a work day.,55
1381,However if u want to go jogging or bike riding then u may have some connections issues and that is the case for most if not all bluetooth wireless headsets.,55
1382,Nice little headphones.,55
1383,"That, combined with a great many calls where the headset abruptly dropped connectivity with a loud ""PANG!""",55
1384,I gave these a try based upon the good reviews.,55
1385,Definitely a great buy!,55
1386,I have had them for a few months.,55

1393,It is very comfortable on the ear as well.,55
1394,I've owned a pair for over three years now.,55
1395,Plugging them into my computer at home was no better.,55
1396,I was too lazy to return it which was my second mistake.,55
1397,I truly feel this is the best bang for your buck headphones.,55
1398,This seems to be common for a lot of these inexpensive headsets.,55
1399,Easy to configure and use.,55
1400,The 220s didn't have that problem.,56
1401,The 90 degree plug is bulky and  rather awkward.,56
1402,I bought this headset to avoid all the wire tangling troubles with my wired earphones.,56
1403,Even Sony considers the mdr v150's to be in the caliber of their professional studio headphones.,56
1404,I don't know if I should get these or the new ones...,56
1405,I got her the Motorola S11-Flex HD headset at the same time and she hasn't even tried that headset yet because she is so pleased with the Kinivo.,56
1406,"If you have a head larger than a 5 year old kid, buy something else!!!",56
1407,I find myself wearing them for hours at a time.,56
1408,"Come on people, they are not comparable Bose or Beats but for a good pair of knock around headphones, theses are good to go.",56
1409,"This was accomplished by using the following steps:
Power off the headphones, Press + ,  and the Pairing button (center)  all 3 simultaneously for 6 seconds.",56
1410,You won't regret it!,56
1411,"As far as the Kinivo BTH240s, I read the reviews and the 'tweaks' that were made to improve it made it seem like the perfect match for what I was looking for.",56
1412,I will never ever order anything from you and I will advice everyone to stay away from your store.,56
1413,"This is comfortable, sounds good and has a cord about 4 feet.",56
1414,Some customers had hard time to fit it.,56
1415,"these are great little headphones, I was expecting them to be bulkier from the other reviews .",56
1416,The only thing it's missing is bass but other than that the sound is clear.,56
1417,"the ear piece is kinda small so it doesn't fight over your ear, just press against it, like I said the ear piece is really soft and nicely made so it doesn't hurt, but after a while it does heat up my ear.",56
1418,The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that I was hoping it would fit over my ears and not sit on them.,56
1419,"She liked that they were easy to put on, and the price.",56
1420,"I would maybe recommend looking up modded upgrades with these phones if you want to push it further, sound wise.",56
1421,Great price too.,56
1422,Not bad for the price.,56
1423,"The company is not aiming to produce a pair of stellar-quality headphones at under $20, just a pair that will suffice for the average user.",56
1424,After receiving this product I discovered that it didn't live up to my expectations.,56
1425,"I also have been using it at the gym for about 2 hours at a time, it handles great.",57
1426,And they are so much cheaper!,57
1427,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DESIGNED .,57
1428,I think these were aimed at teens and tweens with smaller heads.,57
1429,these are great and a great price.,57
1430,These are classics.,57
1431,Definitely a good buy.,57

1436,My main purpose for these are for phone conversations which sound crystal clear.,57
1437,These sound really good.,57
1438,These look odd on me so I wear mine alone.,57
1439,I use these for connecting to a home receiver for watching movies to keep from upsetting sleeping family.,57
1440,The sound quality is better than about 95% of the other headphones I've ever owned (all were wired).,57
1441,"I listen to a lot of different styles of music, from alt.",57
1442,These have definitely delivered on this front.,57
1443,"With these, I get the full surround on my ears, no headaches from the plastic connection, the cord a good length, and the sound is excellent.",57
1444,this has been resolved with the 240.  the blue led light has been muted significantly.,57

1446,These headphones work really well.,57
1447,I recommend these as a good-looking pair to wear in public.,57

1449,"Really Sony, 3 ft?",57
1450,"She wanted to buy some new headphones with her birthday money, so I told her no more than $20.",58
1451,They stay on well even with the sweat and the sound is decent considering the price point of 25.00 I ordered another set for my partner who spends a lot of time doing yard work.,58
1452,Overall it is a good product that I use on a daily basis!,58
1453,If you are looking for a great house phone Panasonic makes one with Bluetooth so you can charge your Smartphone and still talk.,58
1454,"But I highly suggest these headphones because for $11, you cant beat the price for the quality you get they are well worth it.",58
1455,There was no reason to by the DRE.,58
1456,I need a ponytail in place to hold the headband up so that it doesn't drift down.,58
1457,"Minor issue hence the 1 star less, may end up being my fault in the end in which I will update this review.",58
1458,"Minor issue hence the 1 star less, may end up being my fault in the end in which I will update this review.",58

1464,The pink color is a little flatter and not as bright as you would think.,58
1465,"that I woke someone up by calling them at a bad hour, I knew these were unacceptable.",58
1466,I use first one with my WALKMAN.,58
1467,"Theses were touted as noise-cancelling or noise reducing, but did neither - They also sound very thin with very little bass.",58
1468,I am a male with a neck size greater than 18 inches.,58
1469,"But i wish they weren't white, because it got dirty on the inside VERY quick.. Other than that, they were absolutley WONDERFUL",58
1470,I am a bigger guy with a larger head so the headset is a little tight around the back of my head.,58
1471,"I even stopped at the computer in the store and read the reviews, thus prompted to go ahead.",58
1472,Been wearing them since.,58
1473,"Not my first choice when I am chillin at home and listening to Drake or Coldplay but since hands free is the standard for drinving now and wires just plain suck, these headphones hit the mark.",58
1474,"Within 6 months, they started breaking.",58
1475,"Sound:
  Just bought a pair because I left my Alessandro MS-1s at home and am listenning now.",59
1476,The flap is useless and always sticking out making the BTH240 unappealing.,59
1477,You def can hear a wide range of sounds.,59
1478,"TIP:
If you want the ear pads to last longer, make sure you wipe the natural oils from your ears before using them - every time.",59
1479,The cord is very thick and can take a decent amount of stress so the wires are undamaged.,59
1480,I use them to work out and have yet to have them fall off regardless how much movement is going around.,59
1481,"Edit: Long time later: Feb 2016  These headphones are still great., They don't make my ears sore anymore.",59
1482,Great for the price and I will likely purchase them again when my son loses or breaks these.,59
1483,"Be aware though the cord is around 3', so you'll need to either buy an extension if you need a longer distance or buy another brand entirely.",59
1484,"I had to replace them, not because they stopped working, but because I broke them trying to remove the hard plastic bar that wraps around the back of the head.",59
1485,"If this isn't a problem, this would be a good choice for  you.",59
1486,"Where the Sony's fit the average human head perfectly and securely, the Kinivo's dig into your skull and start hurting after wearing them any longer than a few minutes.",59
1487,"Wow, as another reviewer described, these are very uncomfortable, at least on my ears.",59
1488,They aren't amazing by any means and at times seems a little fuzzy.,59
1489,"they are bulky around the neck when not on your ears, which i do not constantly wear them, on the ears.",59
1490,"Cons:
- not adjustable.",59
1491,"There was always something missing: Bad fit, poor sound quality, lack of comfort, etc.",59
1492,The ear padding gets really wet for me and feels slippery which creates an uncomfortable feeling.,59
1493,I've had problems with it pairing at all with other bluetooth speakers.,59
1494,"Sound is very good for an on-ear model, and you can wear them for quite awhile without discomfort.",59
1495,"But you can also tell L/R by touch, on the outside, just above the earcup, the Left side has a dot, while the Right side has no dots.",59
1496,I do find these more comfortable for all day wear than every other pair of headphones that I've owned.,59
1497,"Artic has a large LED, on/off light you can't miss.",59
1498,The headsets don't mush your head and they are very clear.,59
1499,"Only three stars because these feel even cheaper, and fit worse than a pair I received for free for promotional purposes, with a hospital's name on them.",59
1500,"For the price point, these are mediocre headphones.",60
1501,Just got back from a 2100 mile road trip and these held up to abuses of 3 young boys tossing them around the car for 2 weeks!,60
1502,There is a slight delay with the sound.,60
1503,I can hear if my phone rings :),60
1504,I just wanted to write a quick review because of the sound quality.,60
1505,"Bass was good, but the mids and highs were not as clear, actually a little muddy and muffled.",60
1506,Comfortable on my head.,60
1507,I was amazed by the quality of these headphones.,60
1508,These are light and comfortable for long periods - I wear them all day at work.,60
1509,"If you want to try Bluetooth headphones but don't want to spend a lot, these are for you.",60
1510,Well worth the buy.,60
1511,"The sound quality is not breathtaking my any means, but I believe a very good value for the price.",60
1512,"Really comfort, may be too comfort.",60
1513,"I've had them for over 6 months now, and they've continued to work exceptionally well.",60
1514,Overall decent for the price and for the style which seems to be somewhat rare.,60
1515,Would purchase again without hesitation!,60
1516,Might as well get the beats by dr dre they are much better the sound stinks!!!,60
1517,The range isn't too bad either.,60
1518,It was delivered on time and came in good condition so I'm overall okay with it.,60
1519,"These Sony headphones, while not fancy, certainly fit the bill.",60
1520,"Decent pair of headphones, especially when you consider the price.",60
1521,My husband finally tested it and discovered that only the left side worked.,60
1522,I bought these before going on an eight hour road trip and wore them almost the whole way.,60
1523,They're super durable.,60
1524,"Not sure how to resolve that, at least it connects to my phone without issue.",60
1525,"But i wish they weren't white, because it got dirty on the inside VERY quick.. Other than that, they were absolutley WONDERFUL",61
1526,They work quite well with a Nook HD+ and allow me to move without being entangled in wires when I put the Nook down to do something else.,61
1527,Great for the price.,61
1528,"When my old headphones broke, I did some research on Amazon to try and find a good replacement with a reasonable price tag.",61
1529,"as far as fit and comfort is pretty good considering I have a large head

only con is its not blue tooth 4.0 or bertter",61
1530,I can connect even during a call.,61
1531,"For the price, the Kinivo BTH240 is very good, comparable to headsets that cost hundreds of dollars.",61
1532,These are great for driving and working in the yard when you don't want to be handling your phone.,61
1533,The are a little small (I have a big head) but the fit.,61
1534,It is very nice to be able to move around my work space without a cord tethering me to the computer.,61
1535,Great headphones for $15.,61
1536,First time listening to it for a bit wasn't too impressed.,61
1537,"You can even hear some decent bass at a moderate volume, but keep in mind these are small, cheap headphones, not a subwoofer.",61
1538,I mostly wear these for work sitting at a desk and listening to audiobooks.,61
1539,The are good for what I need them to do,61
1540,Both headphones are about the same sound wise.,61
1541,They must have used a tiny model in the photo.,61
1542,I have been using these for months at work everyday for 8 hours.,61
1543,The device wouldn't charge at all so it was basically rendered useless.,61
1544,"I used to use cheap wired headphones to listen to my podcasts, I would go through a pair a month, these have lasted me 8 months so it's a great value.",61
1545,This headphone isn't as loud as other competitors.,61
1546,"While they aren't advertised as sweat proof, I have sweated out buckets with these on and have had no effect on usage!",61
1547,Bought these for my son.,61
1548,Highly recommend.,61
1549,"Also, they look really bad haha.",61
1550,My son goes through headphones like crazy.,62
1551,"For instance, the leatherette has not peeled off even though I use it almost daily at the gym.",62
1552,"Here's the pros/cons:

PROS:
-Sound is actually really good, definitely blocks out all of the gym noise.",62
1553,This is NOT Amazon's fault.,62
1554,I like the overall rating of this headphone.,62
1555,"Good quality, great price.",62
1556,"Overall, I'm happy with them, particularly at the $15.99 price point.",62
1557,I would highly recommend this product.,62
1558,"They definitely get the job done and for the price, there really isn't any complaint I could make.",62
1559,I don't understand why it don't work.,62
1560,If I wear them longer than 4 hours they start to get uncomfortable because the plastic band is a bit thicker than other models so they start to irritate the back of my ear but in a way that is a good thing because they seem pretty darn sturdy.,62
1561,"Sits comfortably over the ears, no problem using it continously for long hours.",62
1562,"I've had them for over two hours, listening to Alpha/ BiNatural beats while reading.",62
1563,We have bought several versions of these headphones.,62
1564,The headphone's quality of sound is so great that I recommended this to my friend.,62
1565,"Our son who has Autism uses them daily, the last pair lasted 6+ years before the outer cover of the ear pads started to wear off.",62
1566,Bought this model upon recommendation from a friend who had used the previous model for about a year.,62
1567,"The headphones themselves are hard to keep attached to the ears, at least mine, falling off frequently with light movement.",62
1568,"Also, it seems like it struggles to keep pace intermittently.",62
1569,These headphones are the perfect mixture of BOTH.,62
1570,I was looking for some inexpensive headphones that would give me good sound quality and this blew away my expectations!,62
1571,"I got these a long time ago, like years!",62
1572,Durability is pretty good on this one.,62
1573,He is a big man and they fit his head nicely with the adjustable sides.,62
1574,"One minor irritation is that the back of the headphone, that is, the plastic link between the earpieces, gets in the way, if I am leaning on my sofa or lying down,  If that part could be made thinner and adjustable, it would be a five star product",62
1575,"I have two of the older model, both after two years have the rubber/plastic stuff thats on the muffs pealing off.",63
1576,Mediocre product and performance.,63
1577,"But, as the title of my review stated, for a set of headphones under 20 bucks I did not expect them to be equivocal to 150 dollar headphones.",63
1578,-The bluetooth signal is pretty good on these.,63
1579,My kids love them.,63
1580,"Things with lots of bass (movies, dance music) have good punch.",63
1581,These are great headphones that block out outside noise and you need not turn the volume up to hear things clearly.,63
1582,Bought this a month and it was working well until today .,63
1583,"Could use a little wider volume range, but for the price, it's an AWESOME product!",63
1584,"Every pair of ear buds I owned got thrown around, stomped on and used even more than I used these headphones, but ear buds lasted me twice as long.",63
1585,They are perfect for the gym.,63
1586,"And they look nice with whatever I wear, plus when I want to not use them and wear them instead they're small enough to have around your neck without choking.",63
1587,This is a great pair of headphones.,63
1588,"I'm in no need of ""professional"" headphones.",63
1589,"Stylish, cheap, and sounds really good.",63
1590,"What we got was impressive sound (sure a set of $300 headphones probably sound a little better, but not much), and impressive durability.",63
1591,"I haven't tried running with these on, but I doubt they'd move at all.",63
1592,The fit is good.,63
1593,They are light and pretty comfortable (very comfortable compared to ear-buds).,63
1594,Highly recommend.,63
1595,I've been through many bluetooth headphones and these are at the top of the list.,63
1596,They don't move around when I run.,63
1597,"I had been searching for days upon days for a headphone, but being the penny pincher that I am I finally found these headphones.",63
1598,(they sounded a lot better) I went back online to find a pair of the rocketfish.,63
1599,"Like I said, I've only used it once, but the one time it was awesome.",63
1600,"Well, four; add on Price.",64
1601,They sound better than competing headphones in the under $50 range.,64
1602,Cons: the plastic that goes around the ear and behind the head is hard and does not flex.,64
1603,These are nice but they don't fit that great for me.,64
1604,These are nice but they don't fit that great for me.,64
1605,I love these headphones!,64
1606,This is the only headphones my daughter does not break within two weeks.,64
1607,My wife likes them a lot.,64
1608,"The volume does not go very loud, and has little to no bass.",64
1609,They ended up being a little hard to hear since they don't block out background noise.,64
1610,It's too bad because they sound very good IMO.,64
1611,They weren't awkwardly bulky or small.,64
1612,"but for about $25, these have become my most reliable workout buddies for the past 3 months, in spite of my manhandling and excessive perspiration.",64
1613,"Rather than sticking straight out of the laptop, this plug inserts into the laptop socket and lies along the edge of the laptop.",64
1614,"My crazy suggestion would be to have some type of small mic that can drop down closer to the mouth if on a call, then just snap back up if not on a call.",64
1615,The sound is okay but they are quite uncomfortable to wear.,64
1616,Buy two just in case.,64
1617,Plugin is a little tight when charging.,64
1618,This is certainly the case here as well.,64
1619,I'd buy them again if I needed a replacement anytime soon!,64
1620,I finally got it to sync.,64
1621,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,64
1622,The Sony seems pretty solid though.,64
1623,im going to keep these until i decide if i want to get better ones!,64
1624,I like the compact size as well.,64
1625,The wiring by the headphone jack is getting a bit frayed on the inside so sometimes the sound is spotty but I'm not surprised.,65
1626,Pairing is very easy.,65
1627,"Battery is a small 3.7v 400mAh rectangle battery, almost the same as the ones used in the small quadcopter drones.",65
1628,They sound great for the price and are very durable.,65
1629,features - the 3.5mm jack is molded with a 90 angle.,65
1630,EDIT: cheap fix for more comfortable headphones is to tuck 1~2 stretched cotton balls into the pads.,65
1631,The units fit snuggly behind my ears providing clear listening and comfort.,65
1632,Don't know what the big deal is for the expensive ones.,65
1633,The only reason I bought these headphones was because I'm a broke college student who couldn't stand the soupcan sound of the iPhone earbuds anymore.,65
1634,"I had one issue with hearing my wife on the phone yesterday, but that also may have been because she was using her cellphone's speaker.",65
1635,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,65
1636,They are pretty tight on the ears.,65
1637,"but still not a bad buy for simple, yet good headset.",65
1638,"For two days I kept rearranging them, thinking I had to be wearing them wrong, because no one would intentionally make headphones this uncomfortable.",65
1639,you are still looking for more pros?,65
1640,"Cons - Ears get a little hot with prolonged use, so I adjust them occasionnaly for a little more airflow.",65
1641,This way I can set my phone at a central location where I am working out and keep listening to tunes.,65
1642,"Next time, I'm going with the tried and true Shure headphones.",65
1643,I plan on taking better care of these.,65
1644,"I'm in no need of ""professional"" headphones.",65
1645,These will be great for traveling.,65
1646,"as expensive but they are so fine, that you should just buy two.",65
1647,"Since it just sits on your ears, however, sound will leak if the volume is on really really high.",65
1648,These headphones are actually a lot better than I was expecting.,65
1649,I can keep alert of what happening around me.,65
1650,things that i like and dislike are.,66
1651,Buyers be aware!,66
1652,I haven't tried it in a noise area for phone conversations.,66
1653,Other than that one small thing so far all is great they wear good and sound good!,66
1654,"If you have it hooked up to a phone, and are listening to music, the music stops so you can listen to the call.",66
1655,"I'm not an audio nerd, so my review is just based on an average user who distinguishes headphones by ""it sounds good"" or ""it doesnt sound too great.""",66
1656,It syncs with my Galaxy Note 3 easily allowing me freedom from wires.,66
1657,"Other reviews on the newer 240 mentioned that the bar is closer to the head, so I thought this problem with the 220 would be lessened.",66
1658,"And occasionally if my phone is buried deep in a pocket or a bag, it can be spotty with the bluetooth.",66
1659,better then what i expected i recommend this item they feel good look nice and they do not look cheap i give this item 5 stars got to me on time and really good,66
1660,They stay put once adjusted.,66
1661,"I can't recommend this item, and I hope they can improve the headphones.",66
1662,Microphone works well and can even be used with Siri.,66
1663,"The sound is clear and of great quality, especially for the price!",66
1664,They fold up nicely and have stood up to the inside of my purse (sturdy!),66
1665,Used my 220s for over a year(8-10 hours a day) and they recently started having speaker issues so I upgraded to these.,66
1666,"Overall, I still liked this on-ear product if you're quite tired of using in-ear.",66
1667,"These headphones do go quite loud, but when you crank them up, they are very bass heavy.",66
1668,"The first few weeks, after about 45 minutes, I felt some mild ear soreness.",66
1669,I can now use my phone charger instead of having to locate my old phone charger and have two chargers.,66
1670,These are hands down the best headphones for this price out there.,66
1671,I bought these in 2013.,66
1672,"Unfortunately, the left side of the headphones stopped working and has not worked since.",66
1673,"In fact, these exact ones.",66
1674,Hope this helps and shop smart.,66
1675,Perhaps there was a microphone upgrade of some kind.,67
1676,"This headphones are very comfortable for extended periods of use, I use them watching movies and they stay in place well with no discomfort to your ears.",67
1677,"Design features:

Size - I would call these a ""medium"" zize phone.",67
1678,But if your like me then I bet you will be satisfied with the average quality.,67
1679,"If you're looking for cheap headphones with potentially great sound quality, you've found them.",67
1680,"What's more, you can't watch video with them unless you're okay with the audio and video not being synchronized.",67
1681,"In fact, the performance is as good, or even better, than more expensive models under a 100 bucks (i had tested quite a few before buying these).",67
1682,"I thought it was just me, but both my brother and my mother had the same problem as well.",67
1683,I use them at work all the time.,67
1684,I had those same ones in white and they lasted 3 years of very heavy child use.,67
1685,When they did work they did a decent job for the price but always had a rattling in the right ear and didn't block out much noise.,67
1686,"I thought she was old enough for this style rather than just ear buds, and for the cost of a modest set of buds, these are really good-sounding, well-designed headphones.",67
1687,Bought these for my 8yr old son to use on his ipad so i don't have to listen to his games/music in the car.,67
1688,"I always tell it like it is, the bad along with the good.",67
1689,"I am writing this after a couple of years of ownership, and I haven't used them for a long time, but I dug them out and tried them again.",67
1690,They are great for running or other exercise.,67
1691,"If you have prominent ridges on your ears and normal head phones bother you, don't buy these because it will be just as bad if not worse.",67
1692,If you read these reviews you would think otherwise.,67
1693,They have incredible quality and for $15???,67
1694,I really wanted these to work since I've been trying to find comfortable headphones for running for a while.,67
1695,All in all I couldn't be happier and for the price it's a no brainer.,67
1696,"Cons - Ears get a little hot with prolonged use, so I adjust them occasionnaly for a little more airflow.",67
1697,"I don't like ear buds, so wearing only over the ear headphones is the only way I can enjoy private audio experiences.",67
1698,Fantastic sound!,67
1699,"I had one issue with hearing my wife on the phone yesterday, but that also may have been because she was using her cellphone's speaker.",67
1700,"They are low, really low compared to the Sony MDR-V150.",68
1701,"Second, they were packaged well and arrived with no damage.",68
1702,The sound is really not to be beat for this price.,68
1703,I have been using these for months at work everyday for 8 hours.,68
1704,I purchased these headphones because my dad wanted a pair of headphones when he went to work out and go about his daily routine.,68
1705,"Three qualities are most important to me in any set of headphones: Durability, Sound Quality, and Comfort.",68
1706,I emailed the manufacturer about 3 weeks ago and no response.,68
1707,Absolutely horrible.,68
1708,Good for working out and casual listening.,68
1709,Thank you Kinivo for headphones that don't require charging after a few hours.,68
1710,I suspect that my product was just an outlier but beware of the possibility.,68
1711,Would definitely recommend in a situation like mine.,68
1712,On my PC when I want to use the headphones I just power them up and wait about 10 seconds or so.,68
1713,"These sound great, and as such make for an incredible value.",68
1714,I have issues with headphones and I seem to go through a lot of them but I've had these for several months now and they are really perfect to me.,68
1715,The service from the vendor was excellent.,68
1716,You have to add this to your collection.,68
1717,This is my second pair - after owning the 220s for a year or more I got the 240s for my wife for exercising and she likes them a lot.,68
1718,The cord length is good.,68
1719,Though not flush it fits your ear well and is not loose.,68
1720,I listen to books on my 12 hour shift and often forget to charge it until it finally begins to die on the third day.,68
1721,"TIP:
If you want the ear pads to last longer, make sure you wipe the natural oils from your ears before using them - every time.",68
1722,they are very comfortable and I have used them a lot.,68
1723,The headphones arrived on time and in good shape.,68
1724,"Purchased in late May 2015 and just discovered it died, will not charge - I got about 18 months of use out of it, but really expected more for the price (around $25 at time of purchase).",68
1725,I broke the first pair in one ear because I pulled the cord hard so I got another pair and they are holding up well.,69
1726,The sound is good but the headband is so tight it gives my kids headaches.,69
1727,I've had a Kinivo BTH240 (black) headset for well over a year and had to buy my girlfriend one too (red).,69
1728,"I haven't tried thee with my iPod or any other devices, simply because I bought them for use with my Macbook .",69
1729,"At the price point I bought them I didn't expect much, a few months of kids beating on them at most, and I expected decent sound but not much more.",69
1730,"Look, you are getting what you are paying.",69
1731,-connectivity issue.,69
1732,"I bought these with a skeptical eye, being that I am familiar with Sony products, I was expecting good sound, but these headphones blew me away!",69
1733,Outstanding product.,69
1734,These are great head phones and don't cost a few hundred $$$..,69
1735,"The chord was a bit shorter than I would prefer, but other than that it's fine.",69
1736,"Now, I figured since it was suck a bargain there would be a catch, and of course there was.",69
1737,Much better than the Photive and low end Sony phones in my house.,69
1738,"Don't drink and Drive unless your good at it, I used to be.",69
1739,Packaged well and arrived quickly!,69
1740,I bought the headphone set for my granddaughter and she was ecstatic!,69
1741,Such a good buy.,69
1742,"These were very good headphones for a while, but after only 6 months, the sound on one side went out completely.",69
1743,These headphones are just whatever.,69
1744,Music quality is good.,69
1745,I was very surprised to experience the sound quality was just great.,69
1746,"Every pair of ear buds I owned got thrown around, stomped on and used even more than I used these headphones, but ear buds lasted me twice as long.",69
1747,I did have some concerns about the comfort of the back neck piece however I do not even feel it most of the time.,69
1748,"Fit snugly, are rugged, pairs easily and can handle phone calls decently (though I have had issues recently where it dropped connection due to low battery).",69
1749,These headphones are comfortable enough that I can have them on for hours without experiencing any discomfort.,69
1750,It's too bad because they sound very good IMO.,70
1751,Very happy with this purchase.,70
1752,The only issue is when my husband lays down to do any workouts on the bench the back headphone bar pops up and makes the earpieces push up.,70
1753,"(If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking ""yes"" at the end of my review!)",70
1754,They look great and connect easily.,70
1755,"They do get minorly uncomfortable after about an hour straight of them being on, but then again what headphones don't!",70
1756,They are also as it stated on arrival-refurbished.,70
1757,"I Google headphones, asked friends for their opinions, YouTubed  videos and ultimately decided to give these a shot.",70
1758,cord does not tangle.,70
1759,That may be the headphones or it may be the cellular signal where I'm at or where the listener is at.,70
1760,These headphones do the trick.,70
1761,"The way they wrap around the back of the neck makes it difficult to wear them while lying down or reclining, e.g.",70
1762,I bought this color and the white one for my kids that last longer than other brands.,70
1763,I don't know why but I love them!,70
1764,And that's what I mostly listen to.,70
1765,These headphones have great style and sound.,70
1766,Perfect for travelers who are looking for fewer wires to mess with while lounging at the airport.,70
1767,I looked at the manufacturer's photos and I am wearing them properly.,70
1768,Some people have talked about the lack of bass.,70
1769,"Skeptics guide to the universe is my favorite, cheap plug while i have the chance, and it sounds awesome.",70
1770,"Sits comfortably over the ears, no problem using it continously for long hours.",70
1771,I originally bought this for a friend since we skype a lot.,70
1772,"I just received these in the mail a couple of days ago so I can't write about how long they last or anything like that, but I can say that I absolutely love them especially for the price.",70
1773,"These are really affordable headphones, nice and loud with decent bass.",70
1774,Sound is Muffled like it needs more power to drive it?,70
1775,I have to say I am very impressed!,71
1776,"This model is replacing the better quality, better sounding MDR-V150 model.",71
1777,Everything in electronics is black it seems.,71
1778,They're just what I was looking for -- though it would be cool if they had a discrete microphone.,71
1779,Got for my boys for Christmas.,71
1780,"It's fake leather, so little black flecks of fabric will start to appear on your ears as they break apart.",71
1781,"Only once did someone say I sounded a little far off, but with a minor adjustment of the right earpiece, they said I sounded fine.",71
1782,The Koss PortaPro is still my all-time favorite bargain headphones.,71
1783,We already had red ones so we knew they were great headphones.,71
1784,I bought these because I like to keep up with fashion and ear buds don't stay in my ears.,71
1785,I would strongly recommend paying a little big extra to get quality headphones that you can actually enjoy.,71
1786,Niceb Bluetooth headphones.,71
1787,They sit very lightly on my rather large head.,71
1788,"They really are ""good enough"" and honestly better than anything else you'll find for under $40.",71
1789,it kinda is even too long for me (im 5'7).,71
1790,Quality Headphones for the money.,71
1791,They feel cheap but don't look it so I guess that is okay.,71
1792,Cops have showed up at my house to verify if everything is okay.,71
1793,These are decent quality.,71
1794,The sound is okay but they are quite uncomfortable to wear.,71
1795,The hard plastic of the headphones band does irritates my ears after about 1 hour of use.,71
1796,I'm a runner and I've been going through ear bud style headphones like crazy.,71
1797,They were tested out with 2 iPhone 5s and the new iPad w/retina display & a Dell laptop.,71
1798,They are comfortable and well worth the price.,71
1799,"All in all a good purchase when I got them, and they still are 4 months later.",71
1800,"I purchased a pair after being impressed by my fiance's, and when he lost his, he stole mine.",72
1801,Very disappointed of these headphones because it came out of the box playing out of only the right side... You may not get a defect like me but if you are unfortunate enough to get one then it's very inconvenient.,72
1802,Owned these for a little over two years with light to moderate use through that time.,72
1803,There was a lack of bass compared to my Sony MDR-XB500's.,72
1804,You just can't complain at this price.,72
1805,"Beats, but they aren't bad quality at all.",72
1806,Plugin is a little tight when charging.,72
1807,"Sound is balanced, not too much of anything (so the bass wasn't that good for electronic music and such, but it was there)but a little muffled.",72
1808,Both headphones are about the same sound wise.,72
1809,Sony and every other manufacturer of headphones apparently thinks the headphones are used on commercial aircraft where the connection to the audio source  is only 30 inches away.,72
1810,Great phones!!!,72
1811,"In fact, a co-worker is so impressed as well that she is going to order a pair for herself!",72
1812,These are perfect for the price.,72
1813,No issues so far.,72
1814,I really like these.,72
1815,I like the state as arrival at their destination.,72
1816,Bought this product after seeing high reviews !!,72
1817,The other person could not hear me.,72
1818,They fold up nicely and have stood up to the inside of my purse (sturdy!),72
1819,It was delivered one day ahead of the scheduled date.,72
1820,This product works fantastic.,72
1821,The putting on the side work excellent even allowing you to talk to Siri without ever touching your phone.,72
1822,"They worked well for his program, and they work well when listening to music as well.",72
1823,Best blutooth headphones I've purchased.,72
1824,"I have bought a hundred or hundreds...  of items on Amazon going back to when it was just books... these are very close to the best value for the money that I have ever purchased, period, not just on Amazon.",72
1825,Perhaps someone reading this review will have an idea.,73
1826,You won't be disappointed.,73
1827,"and as much as I love Amazon, I don't love over paying if I don't have too.",73
1828,"If you are just using it for hanbds free the battery will last for days, then recharges in an hour.",73
1829,My boyfriend got these headphones and he absolutely loves them.,73
1830,"Frame is little bit loose or weak, so it is comfort but easily come off.",73
1831,The fit of the headphones is fine.,73
1832,"Use for exercise: Stays on while I am walking on a treadmill or elliptical, but not running.",73
1833,"I mean, I am talking after a couple hours it starts getting a little annoying with the plastic pressing on the top of your head.",73
1834,They sit very lightly on my rather large head.,73
1835,"It's also a fairly long cord, so I can just keep my MP3 player in a pocket on my shorts and it's long enough that it won't tug on my head .",73
1836,"Skeptics guide to the universe is my favorite, cheap plug while i have the chance, and it sounds awesome.",73
1837,"I would say that it is likely just do to the fact that I am small and have a narrow head, but it is still annoying none the less.",73
1838,They also lay flay which is nice for travel.,73
1839,Highly recommend to those who have budget around 15-20 bucks.,73
1840,They simply hurt my ears after short periods of time.,73
1841,I now have a Sony professional series for $99 which is amazing compared to this $15.,73
1842,"Every time I turned on these headphones, it typically would take a couple seconds longer to sync up with my phone than other Bluetooth headphones I've used in the past.",73
1843,Only thing that is on the bad side (and it may be a similar problem with other headphones) is how to keep the cord tied down to the headphones when not in use.,73
1844,the sound quality is adequate for this purpose.,73
1845,Finally figured out that they hook over your ears besides going behind your neck.,73
1846,Just like other people saying the cord should be at least 6 inch longer.,73
1847,"I have more expensive on-ear and over-ear headphones for at-home listening or music production, but I didn't want to use them for outdoor activities for obvious reasons.",73
1848,"Range isn't as far as the 220
2.",73
1849,Decent sound for the price.,73
1850,"My first set was the BTH220, and I loved them so much I bought the 240.",74
1851,If you read these reviews you would think otherwise.,74
1852,The sound is about as good as you can expect for $15.,74
1853,"The ear padding is very soft, and the headphones stay secure to your head without pressing in on your ears (which I find uncomfortable over long periods).",74
1854,Just recently started to experience distortion in one of the ear pieces.,74
1855,The pair they replaced lasted TWO YEARS until they fell into a hot tub.,74
1856,He blows through earbuds like they are nothing!,74
1857,The charge held for a long time and the sound was decent.,74
1858,I expected better from Sony.,74
1859,I would say this is a very nice pair of headphones for the price you are paying for them.,74
1860,I have yet to run out of battery before a recharge.,74
1861,"The sound is just okay, and I often have problems connecting this to my devices when I have to switch from my desktop to my phone.",74
1862,I got a pair of Sony headphones about 10 years ago that are a lot better than these and only cost me $7.99.,74
1863,I use them to work out and have yet to have them fall off regardless how much movement is going around.,74
1864,Another issue is the swivel on these.,74
1865,you get what you pay for...,74
1866,They are very light and compact as well.,74
1867,NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL and not adjustable.,74
1868,"You can control volume, track, and answer and make phone calls.",74
1869,I have not had to charge them yet!,74
1870,Perfect for every day use as well as recording.,74
1871,This product delivers and so much more.,74
1872,I mostly listen to spoken word podcast rather than music.,74
1873,If you want your moneys worth than your gonna have to spend a little money to get the quality you want.,74
1874,But then I started hearing jumbled voices on a few of my calls and I doubled checked - it wasn't the internet connection.,74
1875,The only feature they have is earpieces that cover the full ear canal opening to muffle external sound waves.,75
1876,"They're small and would be a great size for a child, the sound quality is ok, it sounds a bit low and the bass isn't much, it doesn't sound like the 20$ sony headphones, this pair would be a step down from that.",75
1877,"Love that fact you can actually skip songs on itunes and Pandora, something units couldn't do a few years back.",75
1878,Wish they fit a bit tighter though.,75
1879,"Also the headband isn't padded, it's just plastic.",75
1880,One charge lasts basically all day.,75
1881,I thought they were going to be one of those crappy headphones that broke after you took it out of the box,75
1882,"Nice design, they fit very well and are very confortable,  great sound, easy to vinculate to my iPhone and tablet, the controls on the headphone work great and the range of connection is great.",75
1883,The wiring by the headphone jack is getting a bit frayed on the inside so sometimes the sound is spotty but I'm not surprised.,75
1884,I would say they look better and they seemed a bit smaller around the head but overall I prefer the SoundBot's in this price range.,75
1885,I have medium sized ears and they hang off.,75
1886,"He love the audio books and movies available, and raves about the excellent quality of these earphones to everyone.",75
1887,I've changed the rating to the 5 stars this replacement pair deserves.,75
1888,It folds up nicely for travel.,75
1889,I like them so much!!,75
1890,"Here's the pros/cons:

PROS:
-Sound is actually really good, definitely blocks out all of the gym noise.",75
1891,"A good fit over the ear is also a bit difficult to achieve if you have a smaller head, and I suspect if you had a larger head as well.",75
1892,They looked comfortable and were made by Sony which is a tried and true brand that I completely trust.,75
1893,These sound great!,75
1894,"For 20 bucks, they're more than worth it.",75
1895,"If you are looking for reasonably priced good quality sound, buy these.",75
1896,"The sound quality is decent, though not superb - I have Sony 7506 professionals to compare to for music, but they cost $100 so should be better.",75
1897,"You can't use them in loud spaces, on motorized vehicles, God help you if you try to listen to them on the plane.",75
1898,The price is certainly right.,75
1899,I find that I don't even realize that I am wearing them.,75
1900,"For $10-15, these are great.",76
1901,"The 240 has improved control options, but oddly less range for higher volume?",76
1902,I'm giving these 5 stars only because they do sounds very good for the echeap price.,76
1903,"I've generally been happy with the Sony products I've used, but often found them a bit pricier than similar options.",76
1904,The previous set I owned (different brand) lasted for 5 months before they crapped out.,76
1905,They do make my ears sweaty but I prefer sweat over using little ear buds as I find them terribly uncomfortable.,76
1906,The flat sound and bulky earpieces ruin the headphone experience.,76
1907,I'm a teacher at a small alternative high school with students who have major behavioral issues.,76
1908,I have been using these headphones for months and they are still in good working order.,76
1909,"If you want to try Bluetooth headphones but don't want to spend a lot, these are for you.",76
1910,"At this price point/quality, these headphones are unmatched.",76
1911,I also wear glasses.,76
1912,Just pay attention to the short instructions and this headset could not be easier to connect (Windows 8.1).,76
1913,I'm going to put a piece of tape over it and hopefully that solves the problem.,76
1914,Item is bent out of shape so I cannot even return it.,76
1915,"For its price, this delivers very good sound.",76
1916,I've owned a pair for over three years now.,76
1917,"The sound quality is great, and they do block outside noise pretty well (not noise cancelling like my others, but decent for most uses.)",76
1918,A great headset at an affordable price.,76
1919,Sent them back thinking that they were a dud and ordered a replacement.,76
1920,Not distracting - cannot be heard by others nearby while I am wearing these.,76
1921,I went straight the amazon webpage and found that the Kinivo BTH240 would be a good fit for him.,76
1922,I bought these a long time ago and let me first say that these last.,76
1923,I bought these because my cat was chewing the cords on my expensive in-ear noise-cancelling earphones.,76
1924,"I have two of the older model, both after two years have the rubber/plastic stuff thats on the muffs pealing off.",76
1925,I tried the mdrzx300 and they're too tight and I'm already used to the foldability of these!,77
1926,I have enjoyed them while listening to hours of Pandora at my desk without any notice of inferior sound quality.,77
1927,Sony you should be ashamed!!!,77
1928,"Not the most expensive, but decent enough to listen to music with no issues.",77
1929,It was worth it to pay a little extra.,77
1930,"Hopefully with further tweaking, the snugness of the fit and consistency of the audio quality can be improved in future models.",77
1931,That may be the headphones or it may be the cellular signal where I'm at or where the listener is at.,77
1932,"""They work"" is about all I can say about these headphones.",77
1933,They sound great and have a nice base.,77
1934,The cord is still 8ft but the head set is comparable in size to the Sony's.,77
1935,Such a good buy.,77
1936,Wears comfortably for 4 hour long online classes.,77
1937,I love using these when I work out since it allows me to answer phone calls.,77
1938,I never would of thought that 7 dollars headphones would work so well.,77
1939,"They offer a lot of volume, great when walking, running, working around the house or mowing the yard.",77
1940,"Stays securely in place, even on long runs.",77
1941,Kinivo BTTH240 Bluetooth Headphone is the excellence one.,77
1942,"Dont come here and be a musician that whats super uber quality, I'm not a musican and I love them!",77
1943,And that's what I mostly listen to.,77
1944,Music is full and clear.,77
1945,The only ones where 1. the don't hurt my ears 2.,77
1946,"I'm a college student with limited transportation options, so none of the return policies would even be worth the money for this garbage.",77
1947,"Here's a list of Pro/Cons:

Pro:
  1) The sound quality is great.",77
1948,If you have to go into another room to not hear outside noises--what's the point of using the headphones?,77
1949,I've had problems with it pairing at all with other bluetooth speakers.,77
1950,One minor minor complaint for both models are the drivers for the bluetooth on computers needed to be updated for the headsets to work.,78
1951,"These are so comfortable that I can actually sleep in them all night if I want to, although they were not meant for that at all.",78
1952,I got these to replace in-ear headphones because I'm prone to ear infections but geez even with the volume turned way up they don't block outside noise at all.,78
1953,but i figure thats a given with the behind the ear.,78
1954,"I even stopped at the computer in the store and read the reviews, thus prompted to go ahead.",78
1955,The new ones feel cheaper - including thinner and shorter cable.,78
1956,These headphones are great for my daily walks...they also keep my ears warm in the winter...I live in frigid MN!,78
1957,So a nice design.,78
1958,Great price for these headphones.,78
1959,Always buy new ones!,78
1960,Which is why I need to purchase a new pair annually,78
1961,I use these all the time at the gym and while doing things around the house while talking to people or listening to music or podcasts.,78
1962,"The leatherette ear cushions also wore out after the first year and a half, but these headphones went through a little bit of a beating in their 2 year lifespan.",78
1963,First pair lasted 22 months with no issue.,78
1964,"Deep bass, yet not too overpowering.",78
1965,"Battery life seems okay, but I tend to just keep mine on the charger when they are not in use.",78
1966,They actually provide a decent sound dampening from any outside noise even though they are not noise cancelling.,78
1967,After looking for a while Igave up and just bought cheap... WELL little did I know that they would be just what I wanted.,78
1968,Well worth the price.,78
1969,"Someone suggested buying a pair of headphones instead of IEM's, and I was in a target one day ruiing the loss of my earbuds and bought these.",78
1970,love also because they are comfortable.,78
1971,"Great sound, quality, and bass for the price.",78
1972,"Everyone is quick to bash on Skullcandy, but in my case at least, my $35 Skullcandy's are far superior to these $15 Sony's.",78
1973,Highly recommended!,78
1974,Wish they fit a bit tighter though.,78
1975,Just a very basic set of headphones.,79
1976,"I have dropped them, yanked the cord a few times, though not ridiculously hard...",79
1977,The headset is overall a good pair of headphones.,79
1978,"The padding rests on your ear instead of around it like other, larger headphones.",79
1979,"I originally got these headphones in black a few years back with my Zune and only after getting stepped on, did they break.",79
1980,Apparently the honeymoon is over.,79
1981,But these are wonders.,79
1982,Guess these might not be all that cool I guess I really don't know but if you are a pork and beaner and looking for about the best $30 dollar item in the whole world this may very well be it.,79
1983,"good for rock and hip hop, pop music.",79
1984,"For the sound quality, you get more than what you paid for.",79
1985,1 is the cord is very short.,79
1986,Outstanding sound quality for the price and very comfortable to wear.,79
1987,Great for the average ipod music lover or for watching movies on the ipad!!!,79
1988,If not for the jack being as pictured I would have given this product 5 stars.,79
1989,Just a note ...,79
1990,They sound great and the Bluetooth connection rarely cuts out.,79
1991,1 is the cord is very short.,79
1992,The power switch failed mechanically.,79
1993,I was very disapointed with the sound - needs more treble!,79
1994,"I also have been using it at the gym for about 2 hours at a time, it handles great.",79
1995,These are probably my biggest complaint with the device.,79
1996,"Within 5 seconds use could see there is a very noticeable lag in audio and what the video is doing, a second or two delay.",79
1997,Bought for myself.,79
1998,In the past I' ve had to throw away more expensive headsets because it felt like my jaw was in a vice.,79
1999,Beats are overrated in my opinion and the quality that Sony offers is top notch and these headphones are a reflection of that.,79
2000,I do recommend this product if you just need some basic bluetooth head gear.,80
2001,Bought these for my daughter to use with a portable DVD player.,80
2002,Great little cheapo headphones.,80
2003,After owning these for several days now I could not be more pleased.,80
2004,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,80
2005,Enter Kinivo BTH (behind the head I assume?).,80
2006,"Bought these a few years ago now as my primary pair at work, they're still going strong and do the job.",80
2007,Well worth the buy.,80
2008,"Sound quality is very good for $14 and shipping was prompt with Amazon Prime

Great buy for casual listening",80
2009,"I don't expect bose quality on a $30 pair of headphones, but they are pretty darn good!",80
2010,I will never buy this or anything similar to it again!,80
2011,The other person could not hear me.,80
2012,"Come on people, they are not comparable Bose or Beats but for a good pair of knock around headphones, theses are good to go.",80
2013,Sound quallity is not great unless eq'd - too little bass and treble.,80
2014,Bought these for my son for Christmas.,80
2015,I liked the price so I took a chance.,80
2016,I darn near consider em a wannabe beats headset.,80
2017,They also lay flay which is nice for travel.,80
2018,The wrap around style is super comfortable and never bounces/falls off.,80
2019,My co-worker noticed the improvements that another reviewer has already went into good detail about.,80
2020,Calls are loud and clear and the microphone appears to be really good since everybody says they hear me clearly.,80
2021,I have had them for a few months.,80
2022,I have recommended this product to several people.,80
2023,"You can control volume, track, and answer and make phone calls.",80
2024,I use this for my PC.,80
2025,These headphones have a great noise isolation and you just can't hear much else but your music.,81
2026,"I just needed an affordable headphone for listening on mi IPhone and iPad,this works and was cheaper then stores near me.",81
2027,Other than that they are very good.,81
2028,It was with reservation that I tried this one from Kinivo.,81
2029,"Even though they wrap around the back of the head, they still stay on through my routine.",81
2030,They're adjustable and they still fit my tiny head.,81
2031,I tried the mdrzx300 and they're too tight and I'm already used to the foldability of these!,81
2032,This is whayy better than the bluetooth devices that you simply plug into your ear.,81
2033,If I wear them longer than 4 hours they start to get uncomfortable because the plastic band is a bit thicker than other models so they start to irritate the back of my ear but in a way that is a good thing because they seem pretty darn sturdy.,81
2034,They're loud enough and the bass is deep enough and they have accompanied me through some strenuous and sweaty activities.,81
2035,Even worse with glasses.,81
2036,Pretty comfortable.,81
2037,Very disappointing.,81
2038,I had an employee there offer to actually let me try out a couple different pairs in the store before I purchased them.,81
2039,I bought three pair because I like them so much.,81
2040,"So if you have physically sensitive outer ears, you might want to look at a different style.",81
2041,She can wait until she is older for the headphones that cost 10 times the price.,81
2042,I am so pleased with this product and have already recommended it to several people!!!,81
2043,A lot of reviews compared them to other higher end brand headphones which is unfair in my opinion.,81
2044,The sound is decent and they are pretty sturdy.,81
2045,When I got them I fell in love with them.,81
2046,Replaced another pair which did not hold a charge for more than two hours.,81
2047,I specifically wanted pure white headphones (that one little red line doesn't bother me; it helps me distinguish right v. left ear),81
2048,"Im the kind of person that only uses earbuds but i got this because of the low price and how they look....But OMG when they came i was so happy,they work great,they are awesome!",81
2049,Overalls great set if having chords is really not possible for you,81
2050,cord does not tangle.,82
2051,"But I knew i needed to upgrade eventually, I mean I can't sit here using a cell phone earpiece as my main set of earbuds, that's ghetto.",82
2052,If only my unit delivered on the praise that all of the others held it up to be.,82
2053,"Typically less than a second, but occasionally stretches longer for short periods.",82
2054,I used this when I was running.,82
2055,"They are relatively durable, last about a year or so.",82

2057,I've paired this with my Note2 and macbook air with no issues.,82
2058,I love their sound quality.,82
2059,Love this headset.,82
2060,Decent paid of mid-level head phones.,82
2061,"The sound is surprisingly good, the padding is comfortable, and they don't cost much.",82
2062,I will say that they are comfortable but as for connectivity it's not so good.,82
2063,I think when using on a mobile device the quality of the sound is not as good as when you use it on the computer.,82
2064,"The headphones work with the tablet these were purchased for, what else can you ask for.",82
2065,The ear pads were ok for a short time but also became uncomfortable after extended periods of use.,82
2066,They sound great and the Bluetooth connection rarely cuts out.,82
2067,Plugin is a little tight when charging.,82
2068,I was surprised how easy it was to set up.,82
2069,"(If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking ""yes"" at the end of my review!)",82
2070,"So far, the overall operations are working well and this is a very nice headset for the price.",82
2071,"For the price, I can't complain.",82

2074,I am a transcriptionist and work 10 hours a day.,82
2075,All the buttons were unresponsive and the headset wouldn't shut off.,83
2076,I am happy the ear pieces turn for storage.,83
2077,These things have fabulous sound and range.,83
2078,"After almost 3 and a half years they still do their job perfectly, just some missing chrome from the track/volume buttons and the outer skin of the pads peeling off.",83
2079,"When you consider the cost for the Beats verses the cost for these headphones , it became an easy decision to make

I find these headphones to be more than I would have thought in regards to the sound quality.",83
2080,But it fits on the ears in such a way that it hurts the ears after listening for a while; say 30min.,83
2081,I have a pair of white ones that are running 2 years strong right now!,83
2082,The sound was better than the prvious model but they were a bit tighter of a fit.,83
2083,There is about a half inch of space between the back portion of the headphones that are suppose to rest on the back of your head.,83
2084,"They don't like the earbuds and all the other (besides ""BEATS"") headphones kept falling apart.",83
2085,They have excellent sound quality and require very little charge time for a long playtime.,83
2086,I was too lazy to return it which was my second mistake.,83
2087,Audio keeps repeatedly cutting out when there's a slight movement (e.g.,83
2088,The charge held for a long time and the sound was decent.,83

2091,Wonderful headphones.,83
2092,"The good, the bad, and the ugly:
Good- great ergonomic design, very nice feeling on the ears.",83
2093,You get the value of your money.,83
2094,Even though the functionally a good  the build quality is not sturdy.,83
2095,"Overall, good sound quality, good price, decently durable and comfortable to the ears.",83
2096,Not distracting - cannot be heard by others nearby while I am wearing these.,83
2097,"The playback controls work well in Android, but only work in native apps on Windows Surface, not in web apps.",83
2098,I purchased these headphones after my daughter broke her pair on Christmas day.,83
2099,"Other than that, they're fine.",83
2100,The 90 degree plug is bulky and  rather awkward.,84
2101,I'm going to put a piece of tape over it and hopefully that solves the problem.,84
2102,"But i wish they weren't white, because it got dirty on the inside VERY quick.. Other than that, they were absolutley WONDERFUL",84
2103,I've been using them for more then a month and so far so good!,84
2104,I love being able to watch movies or tv shows without bothering my wife or other people.,84
2105,"For two days I kept rearranging them, thinking I had to be wearing them wrong, because no one would intentionally make headphones this uncomfortable.",84
2106,Bought these for my 8yr old son to use on his ipad so i don't have to listen to his games/music in the car.,84
2107,So far it works nicely but cant comment on the battery life.,84
2108,Great headphones and a great price.,84
2109,"Overall, they were a great value, no complaints about the sound.",84
2110,"I have already recommended them to three of my friends, and would have definitely paid at least twice the price for these headphones.",84
2111,Might have been expecting a little too much from Sony for the cost.,84
2112,"So, I figured since I was happy with Sony, that would be the place to look.",84
2113,They sat for another 6 months until I got around to fixing them.,84
2114,A co-worker just bought a set for herself.,84
2115,"As for quality of material and comfort, I would like to give these headphones a 4 out of 5 on quality of material.",84
2116,I am seriously amazed at how good these sound.,84
2117,"The only things I would note are that they feel a bit flimsy and the ""sony"" logo wore off the side within a week.",84
2118,"After over two years they finally broke on me, one side stopped working.",84
2119,Con: Well you're outside with these pads on your ears.,84
2120,Now I keep a pair in my office and my new pair are my daily new daily drivers.,84
2121,"It's a little harder to understand people that are talking to you, but you'll hear that they are talking if you're not blasting music.",84
2122,"Nothing fancy but for the price, what else do you need?",84
2123,I find the little red indicator that tells which side is the right side very handy and thoughtful too.,84

2125,"Thanks for reading,

2134,These headphones work really well.,85
2135,The design is great.,85
2136,But not anymore!,85
2137,They are great for the price if you just want to have a way to monitor things without bothering others.,85
2138,"(4) The head phone boasts connectivity to multiple devices at once, but never worked for me, tried using two mobile phones.",85
2139,I sent them back.,85
2140,"Not expensive, but not cheap.",85
2141,While the rest of the gym endures the noise bleed through their earbuds I'm deep in stereo bliss.,85
2142,"However, it is comfortable to wear over the head, can be adjusted, has cushion for the ears, and the sound quality is actually very good.",85
2143,Sound is clear.,85
2144,"For instance, the leatherette has not peeled off even though I use it almost daily at the gym.",85
2145,I have used the bth220 model for the past year and love them but wanted a second pair.,85
2146,We are happy about the purchase.,85
2147,I was also able to tolerate the behind-the-neck - it only bothers me when I try to stretch my head and neck back which I can live with (although I think I will try top-of-the-head phones next).,85
2148,"So I suppose I need to order another one, if I can find a color other than blue, red or black that's not hot pink (not my choice of a color, thanks!)",85
2149,"Sony logo does wear out after couple of months, regular wear and tear.",85
2150,It is a great set of headphones for the price.,86
2151,The design is great.,86
2152,"However, the Kinivo BTH240 pair up every time, no matter what device I am connecting them to...and for a $30 device, this is impressive.",86
2153,I need a little tighter fit to make them a 5 star rating.,86
2154,"It also works if your phone is left in the car while you get gas, etc.",86
2155,I thought they were going to be one of those crappy headphones that broke after you took it out of the box,86
2156,"After four years of use, I have not once regretted purchasing these headphones.",86
2157,"Cons: not really loud, its plastic, Earcups aren't really comfortable",86

2161,I will be echoing the sentiments of many.,86
2162,I use them on my daily walk.,86
2163,I will buy more from Kinivo products in the future.,86
2164,they are very comfortable and I have used them a lot.,86
2165,Highly recommend to those who have budget around 15-20 bucks.,86
2166,"For me, the big win is going to a microUSB charging port means I no longer have to carry a separate miniUSB charger (obsolete) for my headphones.",86
2167,A lot of reviews compared them to other higher end brand headphones which is unfair in my opinion.,86
2168,Incoming phone call?,86
2169,The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the band is a little wide and I have a hard time to fit them well to my head.,86
2170,Great for wearing for long periods of time!,86
2171,Had them for only about a few weeks and they are busted....just buy something else.,86
2172,Sometimes you read a review once you already own a product that just rings true.,86
2173,The Sony MDRZX100/BLK Headphones work and sound great.,86
2174,"Design features:

Size - I would call these a ""medium"" zize phone.",86
2175,Sony and every other manufacturer of headphones apparently thinks the headphones are used on commercial aircraft where the connection to the audio source  is only 30 inches away.,87
2176,Just make sure you don't push it and you'll be fine.,87
2177,I do wear glasses but have had no problem with other headphones.,87

2179,Headphones arrived after long shipping timw with faulty wire.,87
2180,Tried it for a short bit around the house.,87
2181,This is still great after a year.,87
2182,The phone is ok. Not the best mic but for the money they are worth it.,87
2183,This unit would be fine for somebody with a narrow head or a child but normal sized people should buy something else.,87

2185,"I HAVE USED MY KINIVO BTH240,S FOR 3 WEEKS NOW.WOW AM I IMPRESSED.FOR 30 DOLLARS THESE ARE A STEAL.I WORKOUT 4 TIMES A WEEK AND THESE THINGS ARE AMAZING.",87
2186,Gave them to my husband hoping his larger head will stretch them out for me :),87
2187,They are great.,87
2188,I charge them about once a week if not less.,87
2189,"Good sound, comfortable and perfect for the gym or riding my bike.",87
2190,"For the price, the sounds is awesome and really makes you feel you are right in either the concert or movie theater!",87
2191,We have bought several versions of these headphones.,87
2192,These are great!,87
2193,They're loud enough and the bass is deep enough and they have accompanied me through some strenuous and sweaty activities.,87
2194,Because the top part of the ear is in between the ear piece and the part that goes behind the head.,87
2195,"Although I received this item as ""refurbished"", it looks brand new and is in PERFECT working condition.",87
2196,"Great little bluetooth headset, great price, extremely fast shipment, great battery life, and comfortable too.",87
2197,Fit well on my head.,87
2198,"You can even hear some decent bass at a moderate volume, but keep in mind these are small, cheap headphones, not a subwoofer.",87
2199,"So great, some jerk at work stole them from me.",87
2200,I really wanted these to work since I've been trying to find comfortable headphones for running for a while.,88
2201,I kept getting the cord of the cable wrapped around my chair or hooked on something.,88
2202,"I was looking for a BT Headset without a boom mic, similar to my Motorola S305 which is incredibly quirky with Win7.",88
2203,"Comfortable, great for bike riding, fits with helmet.",88
2204,"They are cheap and produce good, clear sound into your ears.",88
2205,I tried the mdrzx300 and they're too tight and I'm already used to the foldability of these!,88
2206,Well worth the price.,88
2207,Once I heard them I ordered another pair to keep at work.,88
2208,Highly recommended.,88
2209,I bought this headphone because it looks cool and carries a Sony name.,88
2210,I have always felt like they made a good product for value headphones.,88
2211,So far very happy with them.,88
2212,There is a slight delay with the sound.,88
2213,There is a slight delay with the sound.,88
2214,Wonderful headphones.,88
2215,And there was no way to adjust them so they would stay.,88
2216,"If you plan on wearing these for extended periods of time, you'll have to take a break every once and a while with them off, the pressure on your head can be too much.",88
2217,I'm surprised at how clear and easy they are to use.,88
2218,"We are very actively involved with exercising at the y every day and
use these wireless to listen to music as we exercise.",88
2219,"I don't like ear buds, so wearing only over the ear headphones is the only way I can enjoy private audio experiences.",88
2220,"Disappointed, but somewhat satisfied.",88
2221,If you have hair this probably won't be an issue but its worth a mention.,88
2222,"This can happen even if I'm right next to my phone and outdoors, so I'm not sure if that eliminates the Bluetooth and cellular connections as the culprits.",88
2223,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,88
2224,I got this product around Christmas and  has served me really well so far.,88
2225,For the price paid these are decent headphones.,89
2226,"i don't use headphones alot and wasn't going to spend over $100 for a pair,this pair i like a lot, good sound,not to loud but loud enough,i use it at the gym",89
2227,If you have hair this probably won't be an issue but its worth a mention.,89
2228,No issues here.,89
2229,I thank the many other users for the great reviews that brought me to this purchase.,89
2230,"Still these are ten bucks, no way these can compete with more expensive headphones.",89
2231,"are very comfortable, I like the color green, but on the picture they see green with white, and when they arrived they were green with beige, but equally the use that is given is good, we like a good buy",89
2232,Would recommend them to anyone.,89
2233,they last longer than advertised.,89
2234,"Bought this to replace an older model BTH240 (which was great), but this one is slow to connect, frequently drops out or outright disconnects.",89
2235,"But, as the title of my review stated, for a set of headphones under 20 bucks I did not expect them to be equivocal to 150 dollar headphones.",89
2236,I could not hear announcements but could hear enough to know they were making one.,89
2237,"Sound quality is the same which is good, but they do not quite fit my large head and are not quite as comfortable.",89
2238,"For two days I kept rearranging them, thinking I had to be wearing them wrong, because no one would intentionally make headphones this uncomfortable.",89
2239,"For the cost of these, you just can't go wrong.",89
2240,"After doing some research for the best headphone at the best value ($25 and below), we decided to purchase this pair of headphones.",89
2241,The headband is way too rigid and totally uncomfortable.,89
2242,I went straight the amazon webpage and found that the Kinivo BTH240 would be a good fit for him.,89
2243,"I've purchased other headsets around this price point, and each has failed sooner than expected, in ways that seemed traceable to poor design, workmanship, or materials.",89
2244,I had the same problem as the first reviewer...won't hold a charge.,89
2245,"I've had them for over 6 months now, and they've continued to work exceptionally well.",89
2246,"Typically, I wear them while walking or taking public transportation, so no real advantage for me.",89
2247,"Love that fact you can actually skip songs on itunes and Pandora, something units couldn't do a few years back.",89
2248,Either girls or guys can wear them and they look really good on-- definitely look MUCH more expensive than they are.,89
2249,I am returning this and will look for something better.,89
2250,They don't move around when I run.,90
2251,They also lay flay which is nice for travel.,90
2252,"The LG's were comfy and looked nice, but when it came to walking or jogging they eventually broke.",90
2253,"I heart radio sounds good on it for the price of the headphones, don't have to give my phone to my wife anymore to watch incoming calls due to the in coming call feature.",90
2254,Went upstairs and into bedrooms and it worked clearly as it did standing next to it.,90
2255,MY SON IS 10 AND I WOULDN'T DARE SPEND WHAT BEATS COST FOR HIM YET!!!!,90
2256,The reviews seemed pretty good so I gave them a try.,90
2257,These are light and comfortable for long periods - I wear them all day at work.,90
2258,He is a big man and they fit his head nicely with the adjustable sides.,90
2259,"I was a little concerned when I found these headphones on Amazon because they had such great reviews and tons of them, at a great price, but I had never heard of the brand, nor had any of my friends, but I couldn't pass them up.",90
2260,They are compact and lightweight.,90
2261,Highly recommend.,90
2262,Most of people said it is good for all part.,90
2263,"They're not great for running with though, as they shift small amounts as you run making noise as the padding around the ears shifts.",90
2264,If you're looking for a pair of headphones as an audiophile I wouldn't recommend these.,90
2265,The Motorola's being to hurt the insides of my ears after extended wear.,90
2266,I usually only do it after shirts vs skins basketball games when I do an impromptu press conference or I Kanye Weat my pastor of the church to talk about Beyonce's gospel album.,90
2267,"Also, these are not overly huge like other over ear headphones and since they cuff around your ears toward the back of your lower neck area, it doesn't get in the way of weight training.",90
2268,Maybe it's because I have a big head.,90
2269,Not a bad price either.,90
2270,I would recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of headphones for a good price even if he/she is not using them for running or other activities.,90
2271,They are totally worth it and if your worried about them not looking pretty they are very stylish.,90
2272,but on the good side it would match with your clothing quite nicely.,90
2273,"Fit well on any audio jack ipod, tablet, desktop, ds, psp, etc.!",90
2274,I've had other headphones like these in the past but I didn't expect anything more for cheap headphones.,90
2275,"The ""Red"" band on the right side, denotes which ear which is good since it's very hard to read the symbols telling you otherwise.",91
2276,"Being a rather critical music listener I bought five different sets of on-ear type headphones to choose among, comparing all of them with the equalizer set to flat across.",91
2277,So far so good.,91
2278,"I HAVE USED MY KINIVO BTH240,S FOR 3 WEEKS NOW.WOW AM I IMPRESSED.FOR 30 DOLLARS THESE ARE A STEAL.I WORKOUT 4 TIMES A WEEK AND THESE THINGS ARE AMAZING.",91
2279,They are moderately comfortable but I would not wear them for more than an hour or so.,91
2280,still working a month later anyway.,91
2281,I prefer these over the Jay bird 2s that cost $170.,91
2282,I would buy again.,91
2283,The battery life is amazing after all this time I still get a full 8 hours of talk time.,91
2284,"These are NOT noise-cancelling headphones, of course, but the design features are pretty good for the under-$20 price.",91
2285,I usually only do it after shirts vs skins basketball games when I do an impromptu press conference or I Kanye Weat my pastor of the church to talk about Beyonce's gospel album.,91
2286,"I wanted a set that was comfortable, since they can be on for hours and also noise reduction.",91
2287,"I wasn't expecting great sound quality for the price, but I did expect them to work.",91
2288,I dunno if Igot a bad one this time or not.,91
2289,"AFTER MY FIRST TRY I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM, THE SOUND IS LOUD AND DETAILED, THE BASS IS JUST RIGHT, NOT TOO MUCH TO THE POINT IT DISTORTS THE QUALITY OF SONGS.",91
2290,"If you listen to music that isn't bass intensive or you don't really care about getting much bass, get these.",91
2291,Cord is decent as it should be but top is very cheap plastic.,91
2292,"Love the headphones, works well.",91
2293,"It's hard to figure out how to fold it up properly, not a big deal.",91
2294,I use them at work and it's a great signal to others that I literally cannot hear them talking behind me since the headphones can be seen.,91
2295,He is absolutely in love with these.,91
2296,great headphones in my opinion better than beats but leak alot of sound and they fit well i have an afro and they are big enough to go over that so they please me and they handle bass well,91
2297,The lows are not enhanced and the sound is overall very neutral.,91
2298,"Rather sturdy, feels like it won't break too easily, I'll let you know how that goes.",91
2299,Just a note ...,91
2300,"The sound quality is more improved than the original, and while these headphones do not isolate the user from his or her surroundings, the audio quality is still very crisp and clear.",92
2301,"It's tolerable and does not cause a major issue, it's just a minor noticeable thing.",92
2302,Probably the 300 offers a better bass quality.,92
2303,But I can't figure out how to adjust skype on Ubuntu with it.,92
2304,"Comfortable, and a long enough line.",92
2305,He immediately reacted to listening to music on both my phone or a CD player.,92
2306,I'll use them 5-8hrs a week then charge them.,92
2307,"Minor issue hence the 1 star less, may end up being my fault in the end in which I will update this review.",92
2308,The sound is decent nothing to heavy as far as bass which is fine because the noise cancellation makes up for some of the downsides.,92
2309,"I honestly got these as a secondary pair, when I don't feel like using or lending anyone my Bose.",92
2310,"These sound very good, not awesome.",92
2311,"I had been using a wired set, but let's face it, the wires are always getting tangled or caught on things.",92
2312,I have an app on my phone with an equalizer and played around with the sound settings.,92
2313,Do not recommend.,92
2314,They are great for the price if you just want to have a way to monitor things without bothering others.,92
2315,In fact I can go outside and clean the ice and snow off my vehicle and still get excellent sound.,92
2316,"Gave to my 12 year old grandson and he was so very excited, spent the rest of Christmas vacation with them on his head listening to music almost all the time.",92
2317,"Other than that, regardless of how I have it on, it fits well enough that I can't complain.",92
2318,"Started up my music, my music taste runs from soft instrumental to heavily based rap and rock.",92
2319,"I was looking for some wireless headphones but wasn't sure about the sound quality they could have, this headphones are great!",92
2320,Would purchase again.,92
2321,I bought them for around $20 and it was honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made.,92
2322,Had to figure out best wearing configuration i.e.,92
2323,It was a great purchase.,92
2324,Highly recommended for anyone who wants something good that will last.,92
2325,This is definitely worth your money,93
2326,"They can be better, but the price will also be higher.",93
2327,This is still applicable even during calls.,93
2328,"As the subject says, the poor audio cable caused crackling on the slightest movements.",93
2329,these headphones are the best.,93
2330,"It is not super quality, but for the price it is OK.",93
2331,The range of the headset is amazing.,93
2332,I am not a techo geek.,93
2333,"Well, these dont... they're smaller than they look... they sit ON your ear, not OVER it.",93
2334,Got for my boys for Christmas.,93
2335,The headsets don't mush your head and they are very clear.,93
2336,Definitely not a phone issue as I tried it with several other devices.,93
2337,"I'm going to  keep them because my ears are hurting too much from my earlier pair, and these $15 jobbers are very comfortable.",93
2338,they still look great and put out a great level of sound.,93
2339,It sticks out and just dangles in the air like a wild hair.,93
2340,"The headset has operating controls on the right headphone, on-off, volume, mode/multifunction button and next or repeat selection.",93
2341,they last longer than advertised.,93
2342,"However, it does it's job quite well overall.",93
2343,"However, it is comfortable to wear over the head, can be adjusted, has cushion for the ears, and the sound quality is actually very good.",93
2344,The white makes them fun too.,93
2345,"the sound is ok, not bad but not great either, it is a little tinny sounding lack of fullness on the lower end.",93
2346,They had offered to send me out a new pair.,93
2347,"You would think these would cost more, but they are crazy cheap!",93
2348,Which is why the 4  stars instead of 5.,93
2349,I am very satisfied and encourage you to buy this headset.,93
2350,These are just the ticket.,94
2351,"I haven't tried running with these on, but I doubt they'd move at all.",94
2352,"The sound is clear and of great quality, especially for the price!",94
2353,They fit  a little tight at first but I got used to them.,94
2354,She absolutely loves them.,94
2355,"Once I hear that beep and plug them in for charging, it takes about 2 hours for a full charge.",94
2356,"Hold charge for a long time, no issue in pairing and has good range also.",94
2357,Would buy another pair if I needed one.,94
2358,Con: Well you're outside with these pads on your ears.,94
2359,Pairing is very easy.,94
2360,I have bought two sony headphones in my lifetime.,94
2361,"The bass, treble both are excellent.",94
2362,They came in great condition I really like them.,94
2363,The only difference I see is that the BTH240 uses the same size USB cord all of the cell phones in the house seem to use.,94
2364,There is no tin sound or echoes and they go very loud.,94
2365,These are also very nice looking & look more expensive than they are.,94
2366,I probably got a lemon.,94
2367,The earpads rotate so it is more compact.,94
2368,Maybe it's supposed to do that for when you just want to let them hang around your neck but that certainly doesn't make them anymore comfortable.,94
2369,He has nothing but great things to say about this product.,94
2370,"Stop complaining about how cheap headphones aren't the best quality, I think that is supposed to be rather obvious.",94
2371,The headset is overall a good pair of headphones.,94
2372,They also lay flay which is nice for travel.,94
2373,This is definitely worth your money,94
2374,"Overall, I'm a happy customer.",94
2375,"-Good sound, with good bass.",95
2376,"Purchased for my teenager who knew she wasn't going to get the $200 headphones, and she's very pleased with them.",95
2377,Head phones worked as advertised.,95
2378,"The sound quality is some of the best I have experienced with headphones under $20, you can get a fair bit of bass and easily enough volume to block out the noise around you without blowing out your ears.",95
2379,still working a month later anyway.,95
2380,And plenty of reviewers here swear by their comfort and ability to stay on while exercising.,95
2381,"Before I even downloaded all my songs to the new MP3 I purchased from Amazon at the same time as these groovy headphones, one of the earpieces fell into a vodker and soda...soaked to schmitt.",95
2382,"Low cost, low quality.",95
2383,It gets in the way when i am trying to write down notes.,95
2384,"The sound is just okay, and I often have problems connecting this to my devices when I have to switch from my desktop to my phone.",95
2385,"If you want better quality headphones, I would suggest investing into something better.",95
2386,After this experience I decided to purchase another pair of 220's which I also enjoyed very much before my original pair failed.,95
2387,"The actual headphones function well but if you have a giant head like me, they won't be very comfortable.",95
2388,"I purchased these headphones to use at our home computer for listening to videos, cds, and u-tube.",95
2389,Highly recommend to those who have budget around 15-20 bucks.,95
2390,"But you can also tell L/R by touch, on the outside, just above the earcup, the Left side has a dot, while the Right side has no dots.",95
2391,I think they're pretty good considering I only paid about $30 for them.,95
2392,"the headphones (on ear)
2.)",95
2393,Works fine with the phone function and with Siri.,95
2394,But the best thing of all is the price - $25!,95
2395,The sound is muffled and sometimes distorts the low end if you're listening to a song with a lot of it.,95
2396,"Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.",95
2397,Maybe it's supposed to do that for when you just want to let them hang around your neck but that certainly doesn't make them anymore comfortable.,95
2398,I was look for an adjustment to decrease or increase the length of the neck band.,95
2399,"My son has autism so he is super picky about products he uses, and he really likes this one.. Super fast shipping!",95
2400,The transaction was smooth and the shipping was fast!,96
2401,I purchased these headphone exclusively for listening to movies via my Roku 3 Remote Controller which has an Stereo Audio Output Jack for private listening.,96
2402,The speaker is basically just smaller so it moves less air.,96
2403,"Also keep in mind, because these are behind the ear headphones, if you are leaning back against something, like sitting up in bed or laying down on a pillow, this kind of pushes them forward.",96
2404,I would buy them again but my current ones don't look anywhere close to breaking.,96
2405,"Sometimes I will remove just one side so I can have a quick conversation with someone, letting the music continue rather than hitting pause.",96
2406,"Sound is good, far from perfect but what were you expecting for this price?",96
2407,I've had these headphones for all of one day.,96
2408,"They're not exactly power performers, but then again, you're paying less than $20.",96
2409,Pretty good for the price - just interface quirks.,96
2410,"Daughter's gave out a week ago, so they lasted about 8 months.",96
2411,The material appears sturdy enough.,96
2412,gonna order a couple more on payday,96
2413,But then again what can you expect for $30 bucks.,96
2414,NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL and not adjustable.,96
2415,Really only good thing about them is they hold charge very well.,96
2416,Bottom line: The sound is very clear and they are easy to use.,96
2417,"Great little bluetooth headset, great price, extremely fast shipment, great battery life, and comfortable too.",96
2418,Another issue is the swivel on these.,96
2419,I don't take these outside and I barely use it indoors.,96
2420,But I can't figure out how to adjust skype on Ubuntu with it.,96
2421,"When the opportunity arose, I bought the ZX300 to see if there really was a difference.",96
2422,In fact I can go outside and clean the ice and snow off my vehicle and still get excellent sound.,96
2423,I have used it for about a month now and I love this product.,96
2424,I love these headphones!,96
2425,"The comfort level was among the best I have experienced for this kind of headset, as long as I'm not leaning/laying my head against anything.",97
2426,I took a chance and it paid off.,97
2427,The only drawback was they weren't long enough to watch my tv from bed.,97
2428,All of that compared to same priced motorola device.,97
2429,"It might just be the pair I received, but the range on these are awful when in an open environment (i.e.",97
2430,I would recommend byting this with such price.,97
2431,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DESIGNED .,97
2432,I use these as work headphones along with a mp3 player.,97
2433,"Gave it to my 2 year old so she could use it with her ipad, I'll order a different headphones for gaming.",97
2434,"The battery life is ok, I just wish it had a longer battery life.",97
2435,"Thought about Motorola, but went with Kinivo.",97
2436,"I wouldn't recommend them for hardcore music or gaming, but they're not really designed for that anyway.",97
2437,"These are, in my opinion, quite a step up.",97
2438,More comfortable than the 220.,97
2439,We are happy about the purchase.,97
2440,They work excellent!,97
2441,The only negative is the strap around the head is not adjustable and stiff.,97
2442,"Even when I'm not trying to fiddle with them, my left ear canal is slightly bigger than my right and almost all ear buds end up sliding out or moving out of place, even with earhooks.",97
2443,"The sound quality is decent, though not superb - I have Sony 7506 professionals to compare to for music, but they cost $100 so should be better.",97
2444,"These are listed for children, but fit my head perfectly, and the sound is great.",97
2445,"You can bring these up to passable by boosting the treble, but if you're using a device that has no EQ control beyond bass boost they're going to sound very muffled

The insulating pads.",97
2446,"Hold charge for a long time, no issue in pairing and has good range also.",97
2447,I won't detract a star for this design because the knivo is an excellent product.,97
2448,these headphones are great.,97
2449,-The bluetooth signal is pretty good on these.,97
2450,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,98
2451,I enjoyed very much this pair of headphones.,98
2452,But then again what can you expect for $30 bucks.,98
2453,Don't think it's possible to find anything better for this price.,98
2454,These sound amazing for the price.,98
2455,"these are great little headphones, I was expecting them to be bulkier from the other reviews .",98
2456,Some people have talked about the lack of bass.,98
2457,My mothers pair have stopped working after about a year.,98
2458,"Even with these nitpicks, I still give these 5/5 stars.",98
2459,These are some kind of thin synthetic leather-like material with foam inside.,98
2460,"These wouldn't pair with my Girlfriend's iPhone or iPad, My iPhone or iPad.",98
2461,They are fine for everyday listening.,98
2462,"The cords are thicker than my old headphones, but other than that, i love it!",98
2463,Highly recommend.,98
2464,"I had one issue with hearing my wife on the phone yesterday, but that also may have been because she was using her cellphone's speaker.",98
2465,"Sounds like a $50 pair of headphones, not a $15...VERY worth it.",98
2466,"Smooth deep sounding bass, clear, crisp treble, almost no distortion at very high levels (not recommended).",98
2467,I am very disappointed.,98
2468,"It seems best for walkers, joggers, cyclists.",98
2469,"For the price of these headphones, they're actually pretty good.",98
2470,very comfortable.. easily pairs to my Sony Z3V which i love.. and the battery life is amazing..Kinivo did it right with these budget headphones..,98
2471,These headphones are nice.,98
2472,These headphones are the perfect mixture of BOTH.,98
2473,(Very similar to the Dell version I bought about 5 years ago for $60.),98
2474,I don't recommend these,98
2475,Im sure kinovo switched production to have cheaper production costs.,99
2476,I've love the way this headset works with my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.,99
2477,Overall I'd recommend it.,99
2478,"So far i used to watch movies, video studying in the middle of the night without waking my roommate.",99
2479,$15 for over the ear headphones is a good price.,99
2480,They don't really stay in place for me when I am working out and they do cause some slight discomfort behind the ears for me.,99
2481,"This is comfortable, sounds good and has a cord about 4 feet.",99
2482,"My previous headset, an LG HBS-730 had significant issues in this area, and I'm very happy to say the difference between the two headsets is night and day.",99

2485,"They're priced cheap, another plus.",99
2486,"My Bose headphones died after ten years of hard use, so I bought these thinking they would be a good temporary set until I chose a more permanent set.",99
2487,Don't buy these if you like your music loud!,99
2488,If you are looking for legit stereo sound without paying an outrageous amount these are for you.,99
2489,The sound quality is very good for the price.,99
2490,"I bought it for my son, he loves it.",99
2491,They sit comfortably on your head & ears.,99
2492,"They're small and would be a great size for a child, the sound quality is ok, it sounds a bit low and the bass isn't much, it doesn't sound like the 20$ sony headphones, this pair would be a step down from that.",99
2493,Lost them and re-ordered another.,99
2494,"Fast forward to two years ago, and I pick up another pair of these, but in white, since the others had the rip and the white looked cool.",99
2495,They also stay put.,99
2496,Now if you're expecting a high end sterophile experience then look elsewhere.,99
2497,"The sound is not great, although not terrible either.",99
2498,**the instruction book that comes with the headset specifies the A2DP setting and once i figured out how to set that properly i've had no issues.,99
2499,Only wish they worked properly and that they felt comfy on my ears.,99
2500,"One Con:
I am working on finding the comfort factor for wearing them for extended periods as they go over the ears and rest on the back of my neck.",100
2501,"""I listen to my radio at a reasonable volume.""",100
2502,Can't beat the price and quality!,100
2503,Headset was portable and folded and it included a micro-usb cable and a microfiber carrying pouch.,100
2504,"While not a Bose or those other HD headphones for the price range, I don't think you'll see much better value.",100
2505,I will be echoing the sentiments of many.,100
2506,So buy New from another seller.,100
2507,"Listen to the reviews and you'll know that this is not for someone who wants ""top of the line"" quality and base pounding headphones.",100
2508,"Sounds like a $50 pair of headphones, not a $15...VERY worth it.",100
2509,I really like these.,100
2510,Connected to ASUS PC via Polk Radio amplifier.,100
2511,I recently went running with these headphones on and yes it was charging the whole day.,100
2512,Not to mention they look pretty snazzy.,100
2513,If you read these reviews you would think otherwise.,100
2514,Range is easily to into the next room of my electronically noisy house.,100
2515,They fit really nice.,100
2516,As a result music lacks clarity that you'll find in higher quality headphones.,100
2517,The sound quality was horrible and I hated having them in my ear.,100
2518,If you don't plan on laying down in these you will not have any problems.,100
2519,I love these headphones.,100
2520,"They have a decent bass sound but it is lacking in that deep rumble, however it does sound very good.",100
2521,Very decent headphones to walk around with and Enjoy your music .,100
2522,I'm pretty sure its the connection between the wires and the 3.5 mm plug.,100
2523,the sound is amazing quality is good and i loved the price you cant beat under 20 for sony headphones.,100
2524,2) The rubber door that covers the USB port is flimsy and fragile and won't stay closed.,100
2525,I would strongly recommend paying a little big extra to get quality headphones that you can actually enjoy.,101
2526,Great headphones for what I need them for and for the price.,101
2527,"After all they've been through, they are still working in perfect condition.",101
2528,Not expensive but works great.,101
2529,"The sound is just okay, and I often have problems connecting this to my devices when I have to switch from my desktop to my phone.",101
2530,Cheap and effective.,101
2531,The 220s didn't have that problem.,101

2536,They are sturdy and have excellent sound for how much they cost.,101
2537,Hurt my head within 15 minutes.,101
2538,Without disputing the sound quality they are definitely not over the ear and the Amazon site provides an inadequate description.,101
2539,"In hindsight, I should have stepped up the extra $13 and purchased the Koss R10.",101
2540,"They're a little big at the back, so when I lay flat it does get pushed a bit, but not uncomfortably so.",101
2541,My sone broke his and we purchased another about a year ago.,101
2542,She is happy with the headphones.,101
2543,I also use them to watch Netflix on my iPad and it paired easily with my iPad 4th generation.,101
2544,Good set of headphones for the price.,101
2545,I would love to give these 5 stars.....but these have their issues.,101
2546,Feels comfortable as well sometimes i forget they are on.,101
2547,"Great sound, quality, and bass for the price.",101
2548,And it allows me to be able to speak to the little kids without trying to speak above the sounds from his math blasting out from the speakers!,101
2549,"So I'll write the review with that usage in mind:

Pros:  It's lightweight on your head and is comfortable as you move around.",101
2550,These are perfect for my kids to use with the IPods or their boom boxes and using the computer to listen to music.,102
2551,"maybe i'm crazy, but for $20 these sound 95% as good as anything else out there.",102
2552,Would most definitely buy another pair of these!,102
2553,They are painful if you wear them very long.,102
2554,Cord is really short - come on Sony!,102
2555,I bought these because the wire on a similar set of headphones broke.,102
2556,I haven't had them for long so I don't know how long there going to last.,102
2557,"It also can't seem to communicate properly with my iphone, so that the phone constantly flips over to loudspeaker mode.",102
2558,I love them I'm gonna personalize them with jewels and things later this week because they look blah just being so white but that's just me.,102
2559,Seem to eliminate background noise somewhat as well as people can still understand me when I'm out walking around my plant.,102
2560,But they are really a no go because they're just so uncomfortable to wear!,102
2561,"they are simple yet elegent, they have a outstanding base, and are incredebly comfortable.",102
2562,Its more about the comfort while using it,102
2563,This is my second pair the first worked great and I loved it.,102
2564,They also got pressed into service as my primary headphones.,102
2565,I wear X-Large hats so have a large head but these headphones are comfortable for a few hours wear.,102
2566,My wife has been using BTH 220 for 2 years without any issue so i decided to order the newer version.,102
2567,I just want to upgrade.,102
2568,"A good fit over the ear is also a bit difficult to achieve if you have a smaller head, and I suspect if you had a larger head as well.",102
2569,they last longer than advertised.,102
2570,Buy two just in case.,102
2571,"I guess what they say is true, you get what you pay for.",102
2572,This is actually my second Sony MDRZX100 headphones.,102
2573,Much better than the earphones I just paid $120 for and plan to return.,102
2574,For only 15-20$ you absolutely cannot go wrong.,102
2575,I compared them to the audio with a friend's Beats Solo HD ($199) and to be honest they sounded almost exactly the same.,103
2576,I would rate more purchases but only bother to if I really like them or really hate them.,103
2577,I bought these headphones in hopes that they would look good.,103
2578,Great price for a pretty ok sound.,103
2579,I did sink it to my phone and it was great.,103
2580,Might have been expecting a little too much from Sony for the cost.,103
2581,"This headset is no disappointment very comfortable to ware (I have big head and I will usually feel pressure on my head after 4 hours of wearing it, pretty good compare to 2 hours or less when I wear my other expensive pare)

Highly recommend.",103
2582,"Really good sound quality, and a fairly comfortable fit.",103
2583,These don't fit extremely well on my gigantic (7 7/8) head.,103
2584,"It's kind of a PITA, as I leave the headphones at work and I have to re-pair first thing in the morning, after every meeting, when I return from lunch, etc.",103
2585,I would have given 5 stars had the cable been longer.,103
2586,Don't buy these.,103
2587,"They are moderately comfortable, but can get a bit painful when using them for a long period of time.",103
2588,"I'm in no need of ""professional"" headphones.",103
2589,Don't get me wrong I love this product and I went safe and purchased the product from amazon not a seller.,103
2590,"So they are wireless and you can answer phone calls with them, what's better than that.",103
2591,"They're priced cheap, another plus.",103
2592,I've had mine for over 6 months and I haven't had a single problem!,103
2593,And sometimes they send used products.,103
2594,The cushioning on these old ones fell apart long ago.,103
2595,The sound is muffled and sometimes distorts the low end if you're listening to a song with a lot of it.,103
2596,"Our son who has Autism uses them daily, the last pair lasted 6+ years before the outer cover of the ear pads started to wear off.",103
2597,I fully recommend.,103
2598,The headset works as I expected.,103
2599,For the price these are great headphones upon first impressions much better sound and build quality then a pair of Walmart brand for the same price.,103
2600,Unit arrived early in perfect packing shipment.,104
2601,Would definitely recommend.,104
2602,These head phone are still over the ear.,104
2603,"It's being utilized during walks, dish washing, gardening, snowshoveling.",104
2604,They are perfect for my needs.,104
2605,It's not uncomfortable but it does feel like they're going to get pushed off your ears if you're laying back against something.,104

The insulating pads.",106
2662,I have used it for about a month now and I love this product.,106
2663,"Theses were touted as noise-cancelling or noise reducing, but did neither - They also sound very thin with very little bass.",106

2683,I been through countless headphones and none have lasted as long as these are lasting.,107
2684,Here's a hint: EQ them.,107
2685,I was worried that the area where the ears would rest would be stiff and not be very comfortable against my ears.,107
2686,However if u want to go jogging or bike riding then u may have some connections issues and that is the case for most if not all bluetooth wireless headsets.,107
2687,I'd buy them again if I needed a replacement anytime soon!,107
2688,"For its price, this delivers very good sound.",107

2699,Music is full and clear.,107
2700,The sound is not that great but it matches many of 30 dlls headphones,108
2701,"For those that never tried a pair of middle to upper grade headphones, these are sure to delight.",108
2702,Not sure if the issue is rough use or manufacturing.,108

2730,Each charge gives about 2 days worth of listening.,109

2732,"Nice sound, nice fit, easy to use--what more can one want?",109
2733,"Though I did receive comments on the receiving end that it was a bit soft, and with Skype Echo testing it sounded fine to me (although a bit flat, but I am not planning on using this mic for any karaoke).",109
2734,Would definitely recommend in a situation like mine.,109
2735,Folds up to make it an easy carry.,109
2736,I will never buy this or anything similar to it again!,109
2737,iv had them for over 6 months and they fit really well (i have a big head)i use them EVERY DAY!,109
2738,I don't use a $500 gold cable to connect my vacuum-tube amplifier to my acoustically isolated $10000 speakers.,109
2739,They are not as comfortable on my head as the old Motorola they are replacing after 6 years but they also cost less than 1/2 of the old unit.,109
2740,"I'm very careless with my gym bag, so it's my own personal precaution.",109
2741,"Very good quality, just the right amount of bass and does cancel out background noise pretty well.",109
2742,Controls are simple to operate.,109
2743,"These always hurt the top of my head, even after I take them off!",109
2744,Wont be disappointed it gets the job done.,109
2745,"(If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking ""yes"" at the end of my review!)",109
2746,The only complaint that I have is the headband isn't quite big enough for my head.,109

2752,I love these headphones.,110
2753,Shocked at the Sony quality.,110
2754,I bought these to replace a pair of soundbot bluetooth headphones I purchased about 10 months previously.,110
2755,The ONLY draw back to these headphones is that if you wear glasses (like I do) it takes some adjusting so that the ear handles of your glasses don't keep the headphones from sitting right...,110
2756,I have been having multiple issues with the microphone input of the NEXUS 4 phone.,110
2757,I just wish they included a carrying case so i could just throw it in my backpack.,110
2758,The cord is around 4 ft. in length but it is not bulky.,110
2759,Save money and time here.,110
2760,The only gripe would be the band is stiff and really really wide.,110
2761,Discomfort sets in after a few hours (I've been streaming a lot of Breaking Bad).,110
2762,Great product!!,110
2763,I can connect even during a call.,110
2764,"Best for skinny head people (me = 7.25"" ear to ear)",110

2766,I will keep an eye but so far so good!,110
2767,"Next is the sound, which is very good.",110
2768,"And how the headphones fold up come in handy when on trips, to give me more room for other things.",110
2769,"At first I thought this was perhaps my wifi as I was streaming music, but subsequently I tried with music stored locally on my phone and had the same results, so it appears it is indeed the bluetooth connection.",110
2770,"Plus, a friend of mine called while I was running so it had clear sound and she was able to hear me clearly.",110
2771,Very disappointing.,110
2772,The only thing that is hard to navigate is the volume and next track buttons.,110
2773,My wife likes them a lot.,110
2774,"These sound great, and as such make for an incredible value.",110
2775,"Since it just sits on your ears, however, sound will leak if the volume is on really really high.",111
2776,"Best pair of headphones I have ever owned, and for that price they're a steal!",111
2777,Very light and folds up for travel.,111
2778,I bought my first pair of these in 2013.,111
2779,Another issue is the swivel on these.,111
2780,I bought one for work then I bought another for home.,111
2781,I would definitely go with these headphones,111
2782,It is not top of the line but you will not go wrong with purchasing it.,111
2783,Bono's voice sounds greater than ever!,111
2784,I road my bike around the neighborhood with them on and they shifted alot and I just couldn't get them to sit comfortably on my BIG head,111
2785,Wish they fit a bit tighter though.,111
2786,I had the older versions of this headset and they worked great and this one is no exception.,111
2787,I don't know why this product has so many good reviews.,111
2788,They cover your ears well and are adjustable.,111
2789,First time listening to it for a bit wasn't too impressed.,111
2790,The ear pads were ok for a short time but also became uncomfortable after extended periods of use.,111
2791,"If you plan on wearing these for extended periods of time, you'll have to take a break every once and a while with them off, the pressure on your head can be too much.",111
2792,In case your wondering in those three years the sound is the same (This time I bough the Black Colored Version) so there is no downgrade in the quality that at times happens.,111
2793,"Other than that, I think that they are great.",111
2794,They are the Best I've found for the price.,111
2795,I just like to have one for giggles and grins.,111
2796,I would have given 5 stars had the cable been longer.,111
2797,Not so on other brands.,111
2798,He has nothing but great things to say about this product.,111

2800,"Plus, I received them in a matter of days with standard shipping.",112
2801,I like the white color and the red detail.,112
2802,"So, I purchased these headphones 18 months ago and I honestly was happy with them at first.",112
2803,"If you are looking for a quality pair of headphones but do not want to spend a fortune, look no further!",112
2804,"For the sound quality, you get more than what you paid for.",112
2805,Only foolish people with too much money pay more than this for headphones.,112
2806,He is very picky about his electronics.,112
2807,The quality for the price is simply amazing.,112
2808,There are no better headphones on Earth for this price.,112
2809,The only difference I see is that the BTH240 uses the same size USB cord all of the cell phones in the house seem to use.,112
2810,"Basically, I take VOIP calls/meetings now and I don't have to use my desk phone/home phone / cell phone.",112
2811,They sound better than competing headphones in the under $50 range.,112
2812,So if it has perfect sound...I can't judge.,112
2813,My two boys ( teenagers) use them for school and for their music and there has been no complaint on the sound.,112
2814,"The same piece is used on other cheap headsets I have gotten from competing companies, so I believe it is a commodity part.",112
2815,The cushioning on these old ones fell apart long ago.,112
2816,The packaging was opened when I received these headphones.,112
2817,"As a musician, gamer, student, and office worker, I have a few different kinds of headphones.",112
2818,"The connector is 90 degrees, so if you're looking for a straight connector, this won't do.",112
2819,"The ONLY complaint I have, which is not enough to knock off a star, is the aesthetics of these.",112
2820,I use these all the time at work and I think I charge it once or twice a month.,112
2821,"Out of the box before even charging, this just paired with my Samsung Galaxy S3 instantly.",112
2822,But after 1 day of use I can hear a rattle as if something is loose in the right earpiece after just 1 day of use.,112
2823,The cord is also nice and thick not thin and cheesy.,112
2824,I used to be able to wear a hood with the V150s but the ZX100 are much wider and a hood just looks absurd pulled over them.,112
2825,I have already grown accustomed to not fighting wires.,113
2826,Received these for my 5 year old son.,113
2827,Did I mention that they run for a very long play at peak volumne and they fold up nicely?,113
2828,"These headphones are alright for the task, but two issues are annoying me such that I'll soon be replacing them.",113
2829,"I have bought a hundred or hundreds...  of items on Amazon going back to when it was just books... these are very close to the best value for the money that I have ever purchased, period, not just on Amazon.",113
2830,It was delivered one day ahead of the scheduled date.,113
2831,I should of bought this headphones a long time ago .,113
2832,Sound is okay/cool and I love that the right side has a read mark so u can easily know what side to put where.,113
2833,Don't waste your money on such a cheap piece of crap.,113
2834,"I have spent the past few months looking for a cheap bluetooth option because when the family is at home, and I'm on the treadmill watching whatever on the TV, I can listen to it without disturbing them.",113
2835,Highly recommended!,113
2836,"The cords are thicker than my old headphones, but other than that, i love it!",113
2837,This is my 2nd pair of BTH240 headphones.,113
2838,"They may not be the best headphones out there, but they are a great deal, and still a good set of headphones.",113
2839,You will love not having to deal with cords.,113
2840,"volume is great, although I cannot hear much when I am in the subway due to the noise but for the price I am very happy.",113
2841,I tethered the locking velvet pouch to the outside of my back-pack for easy access and to keep them safe from my textbooks.,113
2842,Sony has had a great reputation for years but it is in decline.,113
2843,Do yourselves a favor and a little extra money on better headphones!,113
2844,"The handiness of bluetooth combine with how small and lightweight the item is to create the perfect ""jogger's headphones"".",113
2845,"Theyre cheap and they fold small, they come with a pouch, and they sort of work!",113
2846,I purchased the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo headphones specifically for walking/running while wearing sunglasses.,113
2847,"The pads were much bigger, and there was the padding at the top too.",113
2848,"Not a big deal tough...

Worth the price, if you are looking for a cheap Bluetooth Headphone, this one is probably will fit your necessities.",113
2849,"Now they are probably a little bigger than what you think, but they fit nice around your ears, and provide some noise cancellation because of that.",113
2850,"However 90% of the time, they work and work well.",114
2851,"I always tell it like it is, the bad along with the good.",114
2852,I'd recommend these to anyone looking to get high quality without breaking the bank.,114
2853,I bought these before going on an eight hour road trip and wore them almost the whole way.,114
2854,"So, I don't know how these hold up to active uses.",114
2855,I also own the venerable V6's.,114
2856,Got these for my son for school and they work great.,114
2857,I also really like the full ear muffs that reduce the background noise so people talking around me don't interrupt my listening pleasure.,114
2858,These are just what I wanted.,114
2859,WIll deal with again,114
2860,They seem way more robust than the V150s too.,114
2861,They have good clear sound reproduction as well they adjust all the way down to fit a smaller child's head with no problem.,114
2862,This is actually my second Sony MDRZX100 headphones.,114
2863,Durability is pretty good on this one.,114
2864,Very comfortable too.,114
2865,I love how these headphones make it so easy for me to listen to music or a show on my tablet while being able to move around freely.,114
2866,These sound great!,114
2867,I love these!!!,114
2868,The price is certainly right.,114
2869,I can use them for an hour or so without getting tired of them.,114
2870,Two best features are the exceptional sound quality and very long battery life.,114
2871,Beats are overrated in my opinion and the quality that Sony offers is top notch and these headphones are a reflection of that.,114
2872,"Very sturdy, stays on your head.",114
2873,Sound is pretty good for under $30.,114
2874,"I purchased high end pair, the ear pad connector broke conveniently a week after warranty ran out.",114
2875,I can barely feel that they are even on my head.,115
2876,"While this a negative, I don't want to wear any headphones much longer than that anyway because it's just not good for your ears.",115
2877,I will continue to use my $5 Koss headphones I got at Walmart.,115
2878,"As far as battery life, I've not had to charge them yet.",115
2879,"Thy are not isolate quite well surrounding noise and sound, U can't wear them in noisy street.",115
2880,"I believe I got a knock off, it does not look like sony quality.",115
2881,The head set is incredibly comfy and folds up very nicely.,115
2882,"With such a short cord, the MDR-ZX100's are pretty much only suited for use with an mp3 player that you carry on you, or maybe with a computer desktop where the computer is directly in front of you (with the audio jacks up front).",115
2883,I wear a 7.5 hat and these don't fit me well.,115
2884,"It could have been a number of things, like my phone had too many apps on, Pandora lost connection or something, but I never experienced those problems while on a corded headset.",115
2885,I was a little worried they would fall off.,115
2886,Im sure kinovo switched production to have cheaper production costs.,115
2887,Just don;t expect too much for $15.,115

2889,I purchase the BTH240 and the BTD-400 bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter for my Dell laptop which I had recently converted from WIN7 to Ubuntu Linux 14.04.,115
2890,These have held up for months without issue.,115

2892,"durable on the touch feeling
easy access, fast connect with bluetooth
comfortable on ears
looks like premium product with cheap price
worth every penny",115
2893,"Obviously, they do not have the fit/sound quality of $200 headphones, but at the price point, there is no competition to the BTH240.",115
2894,I dunno if Igot a bad one this time or not.,115
2895,"I purchased these headphones for my iPhone 5 and iPad, they were extremely easy to set up, they sound great and they are super comfortable on my head.",115
2896,"Gave these as a gift to a friend and received positive feedback as the headphones did not give her a headache as others do (did not squeeze her head as tightly, and fit perfectly).",115
2897,"But, anyway, I've had no problems with the product.",115
2898,My eight and six year old got them for Christmas and they use them all of the time.,115
2899,Honestly should have just bought another pair of 220's.,115
2900,It also costed like 26 bucks.,116
2901,"I have an above-average size head, I'm a husky 6'-2"", but come on, I'm no freak - the product should at least be adjustable to fit me.",116
2902,"For those of you don't need the volume up quite as high like for walking or watching a dvd in a car, etc.",116
2903,"Call quality is even exceptional, though I try not to use them for that purpose, as I tend to talk a magnitude or two louder when I use them.",116
2904,I bought two for my kids.,116
2905,"For use with my IPad, the volume is a little low even at the max when watching Netflix.",116
2906,"As a musician, gamer, student, and office worker, I have a few different kinds of headphones.",116
2907,"these are great little headphones, I was expecting them to be bulkier from the other reviews .",116
2908,EDIT: I had a friend of mine (a youngish girl) try them on.,116
2909,"However, the earphone material broke away and it felt uncomfortable to use.",116
2910,"I find myself having to use the Small Speakers equalizer on my iPod to tame the treble, which I never have to do with MDR-V150s.",116
2911,Price is okay for the quality.,116
2912,Spend a little more and buy something better.,116
2913,The sound is very good.,116

2922,things that i like and dislike are.,116
2923,Excellent value for your dollar.,116
2924,I would have liked if there was a slight gap or more of a curve.,116
2925,These are great.,117
2926,I have finally found a set of wireless headphones that stay on my ears without being too bulky.,117
2927,I even did a side by side comparison to the Beats and very comparable in sound just not as deep of bass as the Beats.,117
2928,"I usually don't take the time to review things, but this product is an exception I feel that these headphone comparing them to beats on display at the store are almost better.",117
2929,"They feel light weight and easily breakable so we've been treating these delicately, but they work great and totally tune out background noise.",117
2930,The various control buttons operate with a nice firm 'click' and their positions are easily remembered.,117
2931,"I do experience some extra noise even with corded head phones, my computer may be evil.",117
2932,"For the price of this set, I'd give it my approval.",117
2933,"Couple of other folks have them, and they all gave me positive reviews which influenced my purchase even more.",117
2934,You can turn up the sound pretty loud and it sounds amazing.,117
2935,Decent earphones for a fair price.,117

2941,I knocked off 2 stars because of the ergonomics.,117
2942,I use them while running and they stay in place just fine.,117

2946,"They are comfortable, and you can't beat the price.",117
2947,There doesn't appear to be a problem with cable charging while in use.,117

2959,and the sound is EXCELLENT!!!,118
2960,"Unless they fix the firmware issues with these headphones, I would pass on these.",118
2961,Affordable too!,118
2962,They do make my ears sweaty but I prefer sweat over using little ear buds as I find them terribly uncomfortable.,118
2963,Even used it for Skype/Ventrilo/Mumble/etc voice services on the computer.,118
2964,I use these all the time at the gym and while doing things around the house while talking to people or listening to music or podcasts.,118

2967,I also like how the ear piece swivels to make a much more comfortable fit.,118
2968,I have had them for over a week and have not had to recharge them yet.for the price they are the best investment with superior sound quality.,118
2969,Two best features are the exceptional sound quality and very long battery life.,118
2970,This headphone isolates just enough sound for me to enjoy the music while letting some sound in which is essential for safety.,118
2971,I can't wait to wear them to the gym tomorrow:),118
2972,Wish these were water resistant like the ones Kinivo recently pulled from the market (don't know why) but all in all these are a very good choice for this kind of head phone.,118
2973,"I use them with an iPhone, and setup/pairing was quick and easy.",118
2974,"I'm still on the fence on if I'll be trying another product from the company or not, because I really did feel it was an exceptional product for the price before the incident.",118
2975,I purchased these headphones because my dad wanted a pair of headphones when he went to work out and go about his daily routine.,119
2976,The only reason I didn't give it four stars was the occasional cracking noise that I would hear when moving to a distant area from the Bluetooth device but that seems common in any Bluetooth device.,119
2977,Probably the best investment I could have made in graduate school.,119
2978,My head's just a little larger than they were designed for.,119
2979,"Sound is good, far from perfect but what were you expecting for this price?",119

2990,"The audio quality is good, especially considering the fact that they only cost $20 on average.",119
2991,"they may be a bit ""old school"" but I have difficulty with the in the ear thingies  that come with phones and mp3 players.",119

2996,I'll use them 5-8hrs a week then charge them.,119
2997,Shipped from amazon and got it the next morning (I'm a prime member so I don't know if it'll be that fast for everyone),119
2998,"Only ""problem"" is the plastic part that goes over your head doesn't bend much so it looks a little funny when you wear them, but not a big deal at all.",119
2999,These headphones have great clarity listening to music with ample bass.,119
3000,I have some hearing deficit so it is much better to watch things on my Ipad with the headphones.,120
3001,They swivel so that it can lay 'flat' but do not 'fold' up into a tidy little bundle as do my Wonderful Air-Fi's (I'm spoiled).,120
3002,"I don't know if something in the vicinity interferes with the connection or what, but I think the convenience of having a bluetooth headset outweighs the few hickups every now and then.",120
3003,"Update - 9/16/15

After trying to use these things for a month I've given up.",120
3004,"I am a little rough with on my stuff at times and this feels like it is ""me proof"".",120
3005,"I have enough slack to wear these headphones comfortably, but once in a while they get yanked off.",120
3006,"I guess what they say is true, you get what you pay for.",120
3007,I like them better than beats.,120
3008,"The sound is slightly better than low-end to mid-range in ears or ear-buds, but surprisingly not by much.",120
3009,These headphones are budget friendly.,120
3010,The build quality on this pair is much higher however.,120
3011,"Other reviews on the newer 240 mentioned that the bar is closer to the head, so I thought this problem with the 220 would be lessened.",120
3012,This headphone isolates just enough sound for me to enjoy the music while letting some sound in which is essential for safety.,120
3013,the 'ear pads' are really comfortable even when wearing them for a few hours.,120
3014,Batteries last ~12 hours of playback and as it turns out they work great for phone calls as well - bonus!,120
3015,I love how these headphones make it so easy for me to listen to music or a show on my tablet while being able to move around freely.,120
3016,It is not top of the line but you will not go wrong with purchasing it.,120

3018,Love the feature that they fold flat for easy storage.,120
3019,I will continue to purchase these headphones whenever they wear out!,120
3020,The headphone jack is really sensitive and you will be fighting with it.. twisting it so the sound doesnt go away.,120
3021,Would purchase again without hesitation!,120
3022,It is very comfortable on the ear as well.,120
3023,These have held up for months without issue.,120
3024,But then I started hearing jumbled voices on a few of my calls and I doubled checked - it wasn't the internet connection.,120
3025,I've owned the BHT220 for years...they finally started acting up so I jumped to these.,121
3026,As I expected of a Sony product and more.,121

3030,I purchased these headphone exclusively for listening to movies via my Roku 3 Remote Controller which has an Stereo Audio Output Jack for private listening.,121
3031,My old Logitech headphones were way better.,121
3032,The headphones arrived quickly and worked well.,121
3033,"It would be nice if they folded into a travel pouch, but with all their other virtues plus the low price I'm not complaining.",121
3034,Without disputing the sound quality they are definitely not over the ear and the Amazon site provides an inadequate description.,121
3035,I have to say I am very impressed!,121

3042,I will say that they are comfortable but as for connectivity it's not so good.,121
3043,I listen to the audio books from my IPhone and I Pad.,121
3044,I was still using my sony earbuds when I ordered these and I am definitely sticking to the brand now.,121
3045,"The buttons are easily accessible, but they do sit flush with the hardware, so it's a little tough to tell if you're finger's in the right place if you're wearing gloves.",121
3046,"My first set my daughter broke, my second set my kitten chewed.",121
3047,It holds the charge the whole time I've used it too.,121
3048,Easy to configure and use.,121
3049,They connect super easy to bluetooth and I can walk pretty much all over the house with little to no interruption.,121

3061,Love that they fold flat and can be stored in a briefcase of backpack.,122

3156,The sound is about as good as you can expect for $15.,126
3157,but they cannot be comfortably worn around the neck as these can.,126
3158,"The sound is great, and mind you I do use them daily, but within 5 months of purchase, both sides of the headset are dead.",126
3159,"Bottom line, music playback is excellent.",126
3160,"If you wear a larger hat size, these headphones are probably not for you.",126
3161,"While this a negative, I don't want to wear any headphones much longer than that anyway because it's just not good for your ears.",126
3162,The sound quality is great on the kinivo.,126
3163,"2) They are uncomfortable to wear
3) They look funny when you wear them in public.",126
3164,"They are very comfortable and they are Sony, a name brand.",126
3165,They are comfortable and well worth the price.,126
3166,and I had it for a year now its been up with my nieces pulling and them sitting on top of them and I will say its put up with all that abuse lol.,126
3167,I used these mainly for going to the gym.,126
3168,I'm rough on headphones.,126
3169,For $12 they are about all one could expect.,126
3170,They weren't awkwardly bulky or small.,126
3171,Might as well get the beats by dr dre they are much better the sound stinks!!!,126
3172,got these headphones in like february.,126
3173,The jack is finicky and doesn't always connect to my computer right away.,126
3174,Head phones worked as advertised.,126
3175,Perhaps there was a microphone upgrade of some kind.,127
3176,My boy bought this headphone with his own money and I just tried it on today to see how a $15 Sony headphone sound.,127
3177,Sony headphones are pretty good with great sound and fix very well on my head and ears.,127
3178,Update: The company contacted me.,127
3179,I bought these because I'm a hooper and I like to practice in the wee hours when everyone else is asleep.,127
3180,Sony you should be ashamed!!!,127
3181,"He loved the design and thought the sound was good, but this past week it stopped working.",127
3182,These headphones are a pleasant surprise.,127
3183,I don't think they are.,127
3184,"I doubt they're good enough for a plane, but for a dorm or most bus rides you should be very isolated.",127
3185,The are a little small (I have a big head) but the fit.,127
3186,"It's got a very powerful transceiver, and will gladly keep you connected across the room from your source.",127
3187,But not anymore!,127
3188,It gets in the way when i am trying to write down notes.,127
3189,"In fact, a co-worker is so impressed as well that she is going to order a pair for herself!",127
3190,They just recently died they no longer turn on.,127
3191,These are fine.,127
3192,Being able to hear in both ears is a great experience.,127
3193,I've had them or almost a year & there has been no major breakdown or issues.,127
3194,"They are not what I expected, but they're great for the price.",127
3195,I am so glad I made this purchase!,127
3196,My old ones had a longer cord but for the price they are still very good.,127
3197,"Other than that they have great natural thumpin bass tones (frequencies) (not muddy or over exaggerated), the mids are there the highs are there.",127
3198,"I tried the jaybird bluebuds x, and the backbeat fits, both good headphones.",127
3199,"Actual, serious physical pain and burning of my ears.",127
3200,Simple headphones...they make the gym session go by faster...the blue part of the headphones are obviously cheap plastic not matted like the images....good headphones overall.,128
3201,"I was hoping for a headset to listen to music while I do manual work and chores, but it provides so little protection from outside noise that it's nearly useless for that.",128
3202,I like them so much!!,128
3203,Because the headphone is not adjustable to your head i try to put the plastic piece over my ears which hurts after a while.,128
3204,"I'm going to  keep them because my ears are hurting too much from my earlier pair, and these $15 jobbers are very comfortable.",128
3205,Buy two just in case.,128
3206,"I've tried downloading various drivers per the advice of Kinivo's tech support (who were NOT very helpful, rushed through our conversation) and nothing works.",128
3207,"I didn't hear the noise while doing the eliptical machine at the club, only when running outside.",128
3208,I use them on my daily walk.,128
3209,The privacy of knowing that my TV viewing is not disturbing anyone.,128
3210,The cushioning around the ear is also very comfortable as well.,128
3211,These little headphones are great so far!,128
3212,These are Sony and at about $15 it's a steal so I went a head and got them.,128
3213,"When the opportunity arose, I bought the ZX300 to see if there really was a difference.",128
3214,The  red light was on while plugged in.,128
3215,"I have already recommended them to three of my friends, and would have definitely paid at least twice the price for these headphones.",128
3216,I highly recommend it.,128
3217,"Not a big deal tough...

Worth the price, if you are looking for a cheap Bluetooth Headphone, this one is probably will fit your necessities.",128
3218,"They sound better, but still not great..  None of my recent headphone purchases can match my 20 year old, cheap digital headphones, which are starting to fall apart...:(  These do look great, though.",128
3219,"Sound is good :D
Although, the headphone jack made static-y sounds in the beginning when i moved it.",128
3220,"Also, the volume is great for me and it works well with my hearing aid.",128
3221,If one side just had a nub or braille I'd have a much easier time making sure they were on the right way (and this would also make them friendly for the blind).,128
3222,This is my fourth set of these headphones.,128
3223,Excellent sound quality.,128
3224,The package was nice and not hard to unwrap.,128
3225,"I would have easily paid double for these headphones, and still given them 5 stars.",129
3226,I use these as work headphones along with a mp3 player.,129
3227,Now I keep a pair in my office and my new pair are my daily new daily drivers.,129
3228,Sony is a great brand got the white  color.,129
3229,"These are nice headphones, delivers in sound both bass and treble, works great with MP3 players (battery drainer) but sounds and looks great.",129
3230,I suppose I was expecting too much at this price range!,129
3231,A great purchase!!!!,129
3232,Bought these specifically to use with my Dish Network Hopper.,129
3233,They are very lightweight and fit over my ears well.,129
3234,"These did the trick, and for less than 20 dollars.",129
3235,paired with my iphone5 - they aren't loud enough for my type of use ( mountain bike riding - working out- running) .,129
3236,"I would say that it is likely just do to the fact that I am small and have a narrow head, but it is still annoying none the less.",129
3237,I love these!!!,129
3238,There's now a rubber cover on the micro USB jack; added protection from the elements and looks better.,129
3239,There was nothing misleading in the description - I think it states 47 1/2 inches and this is accurate.,129
3240,"For a Dark Side of the Moon session, you'll want better.",129
3241,"I figured that if they were no good, I would lose only $15.",129
3242,"It is not super quality, but for the price it is OK.",129
3243,"Well, these dont... they're smaller than they look... they sit ON your ear, not OVER it.",129
3244,"For 5 dollars more, the Sony MDR-V150 headphones are WAY better.",129
3245,"I would try and ""return"" it but it says you can only return an UNOPENED item.",129
3246,They looked comfortable and were made by Sony which is a tried and true brand that I completely trust.,129
3247,I just like to have one for giggles and grins.,129
3248,I even got a hug 3 days ago from the 9 year old for buying them.,129
3249,It's comfortable.,129
3250,"It was reasonably comfortable and the sound was surprisingly good, but the volume was uneven, the left side was noticeably quieter than the right.",130
3251,"i also haven't been very gentle with them, so i tend to take them off by sliding them off one ear and kinda yanking them off the other in one swift motion...and the frame hasn't twisted or bent in any way.",130
3252,"I had been searching for days upon days for a headphone, but being the penny pincher that I am I finally found these headphones.",130
3253,Will keep searching for a better one to try.,130
3254,They needed charging & so I charged it to full battery & they worked for an hour after turning them on & faded out.,130
3255,"Even when I'm not trying to fiddle with them, my left ear canal is slightly bigger than my right and almost all ear buds end up sliding out or moving out of place, even with earhooks.",130
3256,They have a VERY CLEAR sound.,130
3257,I am an editor and I use these for simple editing in coffee shops.,130
3258,They are very lightweight and fit over my ears well.,130
3259,The cable is a quite a bit shorter than the 7506s.,130
3260,If you have a lot of music on your cell phone you will enjoy this headset.they are very comfortable to wearand the batteries last all day.,130
3261,"Sound:
  Just bought a pair because I left my Alessandro MS-1s at home and am listenning now.",130
3262,"I mainly use my headphones at the gym, watching videos on the elliptical machine and listening to music while working out.",130
3263,"They are extremely loud, which is great in a way because you know the button is actually pressed, but at the same time, isn't very appealing when you're listening to something at a low volume or have overly sensitive ears.",130
3264,They stick out a lot and make you look funny.,130
3265,He is also picky.,130
3266,"they may be a bit ""old school"" but I have difficulty with the in the ear thingies  that come with phones and mp3 players.",130
3267,These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've owned.,130
3268,These are great headphones that block out outside noise and you need not turn the volume up to hear things clearly.,130
3269,"By the way, the sound quality is very nice.",130
3270,"The controls are a delight to use, and easy for your fingers to scope out, even though you can't see them.",130
3271,I emailed the manufacturer about 3 weeks ago and no response.,130
3272,"I think there are room for improvements, but for the price, it is worth purchasing.",130
3273,for someone who is really clumsy and is used to breaking headphones all the time this is perfect.,130
3274,I will be returning them.,130
3275,"I've tried downloading various drivers per the advice of Kinivo's tech support (who were NOT very helpful, rushed through our conversation) and nothing works.",131
3276,"I am a little rough with on my stuff at times and this feels like it is ""me proof"".",131
3277,"However, they are not comfortable for children or people who have slightly smaller heads.",131
3278,"After prolonged use and removing, my ears don't feel like I just came out of a compression chamber, and while my ears may feel warm, they aren't sweaty.",131
3279,"They are easy to pair, work well with my Galaxy S4 and I like that you can raise the volume even though the phone volume has topped off.",131
3280,No matter what brand.,131
3281,you are still looking for more pros?,131
3282,"They may not be the best headphones out there, but they are a great deal, and still a good set of headphones.",131
3283,"The sound is great, and mind you I do use them daily, but within 5 months of purchase, both sides of the headset are dead.",131
3284,I would press the wrong button and ignore a call rather than answering it.,131
3285,I can't believe the quality of it.,131
3286,Very pleased thus far with the product and  Blue Rigger service.,131
3287,"This is my second pair of Kinivo headset, I own the BTH220 and the BTH240 is a nice upgrade, buttons feel much better.",131
3288,I got these headphones in an odd way.,131
3289,I finally got it to sync.,131
3290,This headset sits slightly awkward during running but stays on for a while.,131
3291,I've only given them a 4 star because I've only had them for 2 weeks :) we'll see how things go in the months to come :),131
3292,It has pretty long range too?,131
3293,Battery last a lot too!,131
3294,Not distracting - cannot be heard by others nearby while I am wearing these.,131
3295,"The wife liked them so much for the gym, she had me order her a second set to wear at work.",131
3296,"The chord was a bit shorter than I would prefer, but other than that it's fine.",131
3297,They fit my grand-daughter's head perfect so they can listen to television without disturbing others.,131
3298,So after eliminating issues with the devices it only leave the headphones.,131
3299,The sound is very clear and the bass is very defined.,131
3300,It gets the job done for the price one thing that is annoying is that you have to pair it every time you use it you can't just turn on your bluetooth and go like others after pairing it the first time,132
3301,In regards to sound it does fine.,132
3302,"By the way, good sound for the price, and they're comfy on the hearing catchers.",132
3303,Good quality earphones.,132
3304,Great for the price and I will likely purchase them again when my son loses or breaks these.,132
3305,They have been great!,132
3306,":)

My little guy likes them also!",132
3307,These headphones were exactly what I was looking for.,132
3308,"I had one issue with hearing my wife on the phone yesterday, but that also may have been because she was using her cellphone's speaker.",132
3309,I do not like those earbud style headsets.,132
3310,I suspect that my product was just an outlier but beware of the possibility.,132
3311,"Let me tell you, these things can take a beating.",132
3312,But maybe I am used to earbuds.,132
3313,"Sound:
  Just bought a pair because I left my Alessandro MS-1s at home and am listenning now.",132
3314,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,132
3315,"It's possible I just got a bad pair, but I suggest avoiding these anyway.",132
3316,These are perfect for what I need.,132
3317,This is actually the second pair of these that I've purchased.,132
3318,"All in all a wonderful product, at an amazing price.",132
3319,"Pros:
-Well built
-Good price

Cons:
-Wire randomly twists after normal use

the wires twist into themselves after using them for only a few days.",132
3320,I compared them to the audio with a friend's Beats Solo HD ($199) and to be honest they sounded almost exactly the same.,132
3321,This is my second Kinivo and I absolutely enjoy it.,132
3322,"The ear padding is very soft, and the headphones stay secure to your head without pressing in on your ears (which I find uncomfortable over long periods).",132
3323,After owning these for several days now I could not be more pleased.,132
3324,Be careful handling them until you figure how they unfold out and fold up... as they're fragile compared to Sony MDR700V's.,132
3325,I bought my daughter a pair for Christmas because I liked the color.,133
3326,Just got these a couple days ago and I'm very pleased.,133
3327,My previous experience with bluetooth devices seemed to have a larger range than that.,133
3328,"Bought these on: August 8, 2014.",133
3329,I have these in white and they are very good for what I need them.,133
3330,"Either way, they're good enough for me.",133
3331,"They look a lot cheaper than you'd expect, even though they're so cheap.",133
3332,"The only issue I've encountered is that I like to use this pair with multiple devices (phone/tablet/computer), and on occasion I have to repair.",133
3333,"I chose Sony because the extension connecting the headphones to any device is flexible, thus allowing the headphones to last longer despite.",133
3334,(I am not a heavy figure).,133
3335,These solve both problems!,133
3336,"You can use it on your Computer ""Mac or PC"" or on your cellphone.",133
3337,I can't believe how small this headset really is.,133
3338,"So they are wireless and you can answer phone calls with them, what's better than that.",133
3339,I have not had to charge them yet!,133
3340,It's not a big difference -- it took several back-and-forths to pin it down --  but it is noticeable.,133
3341,"So as long as you are not not using them in that situation, they work great and they are comfortable.",133
3342,I mostly listen to spoken word podcast rather than music.,133
3343,things that i like and dislike are.,133
3344,I also have had and used similar type headsets like the Rocketfish RF-MAB2.,133
3345,Something I cannot do with a couple of other headphones I own that have oval shaped cushions (i.e.,133
3346,The only negative thing I can say about the headphones at this time has to do with the rubber piece covering the charging plug.,133
3347,I use them with my smartphone and if I'm watching television or listening to music all I have to do is push a button on the side to answer a call.,133
3348,"Overall: decent headphones, obviously they're $15 so they're not great, but they do good enough.",133
3349,"When I listen to all my favorite song's the  sound's on this Sony stereo headphone's are great you can hear the music more,it tune's out any other sound around you.",133
3350,"Next time, I'm going with the tried and true Shure headphones.",134
3351,After the first time I charged up the headset the rubber flap that covers the USB port won't seal closed and flops open a bit.,134
3352,"Overall they are probably better for ST listening, not something you could fall asleep in.",134
3353,"Theyre cheap and they fold small, they come with a pouch, and they sort of work!",134
3354,Such a good buy.,134
3355,These headphones were a very comfortable fit for me and have remained durable even after being carelessly handled several times.,134
3356,"You would think these would cost more, but they are crazy cheap!",134
3357,I love these headphones.,134
3358,They're just what I was looking for -- though it would be cool if they had a discrete microphone.,134
3359,The only negative is the material around the headphones has started to peel off.,134
3360,"Sound:
+ Mostly full range, loud, crisp and clear in most of the needed range.",134
3361,I think these things will cause wear over time and cause these sort of issues.,134
3362,I saw several people during my travels wearing these headphones so I would guess they are fairly popular.,134
3363,"The sound quality is not breathtaking my any means, but I believe a very good value for the price.",134
3364,"Once your headphones and device are connected, they're basically ready.",134
3365,No deep bass like Bose but good dynamic sound & switching to phone calls is seamless.,134
3366,"Cons
- Slight rattle - I own a couple of pairs of these headphones.",134
3367,"Clear sounds, lightweight, easy to wear.",134
3368,They are pretty tight on the ears.,134
3369,so why would i rate this thing 5 stars?,134
3370,These headphones are great for my daily walks...they also keep my ears warm in the winter...I live in frigid MN!,134
3371,It is comfortable and has intuitive controls.,134
3372,"Reveals unknown facts of the sex, drugs, and rock and roll, also includes a very personal account of Ann's struggle with her weight.",134
3373,I now have a Sony professional series for $99 which is amazing compared to this $15.,134
3374,"I bought the new one because I lost the other ones again, and I wanted a separate pair for work.",134
3375,These are fancy and cheap and got good sound quality.,135
3376,"They are not the top of the line, but if you just want comfortable headphones for regular listening...these are great!",135
3377,Keep looking guys & gals.,135
3378,"The treble is generally a little low, but you can change your EQ settings and it'll be fine.",135
3379,They don't really serve the purpose for what I wanted them for.,135
3380,It does not fit to charge it!,135
3381,I've bought some headphones that pressed against my ears too much and made me uncomfortable and some other headphones that couldn't take a beating and broke down too fast.,135
3382,"Great set of headphones,I bought these for my shortwave radio.",135
3383,If that could get fixed I'd love these.,135
3384,Does not feel flimsy at all.,135
3385,"The first few weeks, after about 45 minutes, I felt some mild ear soreness.",135
3386,I must say my head is all of 71/2 in.,135
3387,I get great signal in the room I lift in and even a few rooms over through walls.,135
3388,"These are nice headphones, delivers in sound both bass and treble, works great with MP3 players (battery drainer) but sounds and looks great.",135
3389,But there are other affordable options out there that perform a little better.,135
3390,Great sound quality and able to move from room to room in house without loosing any sound (from end to end).,135
3391,"If you consider the price, it can't be any better than this product.",135
3392,"if i had to choose the price, i would price it at $34.99.",135
3393,If that is the purpose it is,135
3394,"I'm a trained audio engineer, but I get that these are cheap-o headphones.",135
3395,After more than a year and it's still working like new!,135
3396,"However, the time has come to replace them.",135
3397,"Comfortable, and a long enough line.",135
3398,They are totally worth it and if your worried about them not looking pretty they are very stylish.,135
3399,"I think that it was designed for a no longer satisfaction, i don't want buying another one, i'm afraid i lost my money.",135
3400,"Oh, and if you have a big head don't even bother.",136
3401,"I have been looking everywhere for the right pair of workout headphones, and these are it!",136
3402,You won't regret it!,136
3403,I was hoping the next iteration would be an upgrade all around.,136
3404,They're just not for me.,136
3405,I love their sound quality.,136
3406,"The phones fold/flatten to a nice compact size, great for smaller bags.",136
3407,"Dont come here and be a musician that whats super uber quality, I'm not a musican and I love them!",136
3408,I also love the bluetooth - I feel so free.,136
3409,You just pop these on your head and you forget it.,136
3410,Not bad for the price.,136
3411,The bad: Maybe I have bigger ears but sometimes they take some fiddling to get comfortable on my head.,136
3412,I'd wonder if someone with normal or large ears might have some trouble with the size of the ear pieces.,136
3413,A real plus is that I can war them at home and not have to have my phone close.,136
3414,Bottom line: The sound is very clear and they are easy to use.,136
3415,"I wanted a set that was comfortable, since they can be on for hours and also noise reduction.",136
3416,"after 1 hour of this thing, my head starts hurting cause the headband on top is made of hard plastic.",136
3417,"They sound better, but still not great..  None of my recent headphone purchases can match my 20 year old, cheap digital headphones, which are starting to fall apart...:(  These do look great, though.",136
3418,It seems to me that they last wayyyy longer than 10 hours.,136
3419,"They looked all right during the purchase, but after receiving it and actually wearing it to and from the gym, I have to honestly say they're not the coolest of things.",136
3420,I bought these for an auditory discrimination program for my son's therapy.,136
3421,"A note about the cord, It's short.",136
3422,That will be the only negative I could find with these headphones.,136
3423,"Not too flexible, so wide heads may have difficulty.",136
3424,"The sound is good and it works as it should, but it's a bit tight over the ears and it's a bit uncomfortable when wearing sunglasses since both would rest over your ear.",136
3425,For $12 they are about all one could expect.,137
3426,Not so on other brands.,137
3427,The over-the-ear design works great -- they stay firmly attached even when I am moving about.,137

3445,We have 3 pairs of these in our house as everyone kept stealing mine.,137
3446,The quality for the price is simply amazing.,137

3449,"These always hurt the top of my head, even after I take them off!",137
3450,These are my first set of bluetooth headphones and most of my use of these is listening to audiobooks on a Samsung Galaxy Note II.,138

3465,"Gave these as a gift to a friend and received positive feedback as the headphones did not give her a headache as others do (did not squeeze her head as tightly, and fit perfectly).",138
3466,so we got another 2 pairs one for each kid and in different colors.,138
3467,The biggest difference between these and the old V 150's is that those were very dark and even more veiled sounding.,138

3494,I am returning them and buying a new pair once more hopefully these will not cut in and out.,139
3495,Because I really like the headphones a LOT!,139
3496,"The sound is fine, exactly what you'd expect from Sony, even at $16 for the headphones.",139
3497,It gets the job done for the price one thing that is annoying is that you have to pair it every time you use it you can't just turn on your bluetooth and go like others after pairing it the first time,139
3498,"Cons
- Slight rattle - I own a couple of pairs of these headphones.",139

3508,"It also works if your phone is left in the car while you get gas, etc.",140

3513,"Songs that I've listened to for years, I can hear so clearly.",140
3514,EDIT: cheap fix for more comfortable headphones is to tuck 1~2 stretched cotton balls into the pads.,140
3515,The quality for the price is simply amazing.,140

3524,In regards to sound it does fine.,140
3525,Those could break easily.,141
3526,These came to me broken and I think that stands as a testament to the poor build quality on these headphones.,141

3536,I would buy again.,141
3537,Tried another brand but they weren't as nice as these by a long shot.,141
3538,If you are looking for legit stereo sound without paying an outrageous amount these are for you.,141

3544,podcasts and such.,141

3546,"The headphones are light, featuring a nice, thick cable.",141
3547,It's a lifesaver!,141

3707,I was hoping the next iteration would be an upgrade all around.,148
3708,"These are simple, lightweight and sound good.",148
3709,The headphone's sound is clear and flat in the mid range and part of the high frequency range.,148
3710,We use the new set for audio and phone calls only.,148
3711,I enjoyed very much this pair of headphones.,148
3712,"Haven't tested them out as a hands-free set or for streaming music from another device (iPad, etc.).",148
3713,Thought about trying others just to compare but had to stick with this great product at a great price.,148
3714,Overall a good pair of headphones for a good price.,148
3715,Do not buy if you have large ears.,148
3716,"I haven't had mine for very long and they seem to be made of cheap plastic, but Sony products tend to last a long time, so I'm not sure about the life span of these.",148
3717,"Without a little ear bud that I have to drill into my ear, avoiding earring studs, they rest very comfortable around my ears and don't make me feel like I'm doing a wax extraction every time I remove them.",148
3718,"I own a Kinivo Bluetooth adapter to use these headphones with my Windows PC, when using Skype and when my smartphone is connected to the PC.",148
3719,"I wouldn't recommend them for hardcore music or gaming, but they're not really designed for that anyway.",148
3720,That alone is worth 5-stars.,148
3721,"After receiving them timely, putting one set on the shelf, I hooked up the first set.",148
3722,"You can even hear some decent bass at a moderate volume, but keep in mind these are small, cheap headphones, not a subwoofer.",148
3723,"They also cancel other sound remarkable well, almost dangerously so if they were worn outside running!",148
3724,"They are a little bigger, but they fold up more easily and can be wound up and tossed in a bag.",148
3725,Also whenever there is high bass the left side begins to rattle badly which disrupts my music.,149
3726,But my apple earbuds have lasted much longer than that.,149
3727,"When they arrived, with other things that I had ordered, the headphone package was open, the edges of it were all worn and torn.",149
3728,"The Kinivo BTH-240's do however sound clean, clear and just as good as high end ear-bud's.",149
3729,"The plastic is just porous enough to take to sharpies, paint markers, and stickers, so you can customize them to your heart's content.",149
3730,It folds up nicely for travel.,149
3731,Highly recommend!,149
3732,Paired right away with no issues.,149
3733,Somewhat comfy.,149
3734,"Normally I'm not one to write negative reviews, but yikes, I'm pretty dissatisfied with these headphones, even for the $20 I paid.",149
3735,"I purchased a pair after being impressed by my fiance's, and when he lost his, he stole mine.",149
3736,"However, for me, it's really minimal.",149
3737,You will not get any appreciably better audio quality with more expensive headphones like Beats for 100s of dollars more.,149
3738,I am very disappointed.,149
3739,Pretty decent sound quality.,149
3740,Quality Headphones for the money.,149
3741,The power switch failed mechanically.,149
3742,He listens to a lot of classic rock so the 1st song he listened to was Kashmir by Led Zeppelin and he said it sounded phenomenal!,149
3743,"Cons:
- not adjustable.",149
3744,"Probably needless to say, the Bose OE2 lightweight headphones, also top rated by Consumer Reports, sound the best.",149
3745,iv had them for over 6 months and they fit really well (i have a big head)i use them EVERY DAY!,149
3746,"The louder you set the volume, the shorter the battery life.",149
3747,"Well, here we are a year later and one of the speakers doesn't work.",149
3748,"good for rock and hip hop, pop music.",149
3749,He uses them often with his iPod.,149
3750,These look odd on me so I wear mine alone.,150
3751,Got these for my son for school and they work great.,150
3752,"I was a little concerned when I found these headphones on Amazon because they had such great reviews and tons of them, at a great price, but I had never heard of the brand, nor had any of my friends, but I couldn't pass them up.",150
3753,But the effort is worth it with the Kinivo 240s.,150
3754,I wasn't disappointed.,150
3755,"The pads were much bigger, and there was the padding at the top too.",150
3756,"This was a gift to a friend, but I also have a black one and I use it everyday.",150
3757,"FYI, these are awesome but they do not fold unless I am missing something!",150
3758,Bought these for quiet netflix watching and song listening on my chrome book and these definitely do the trick.,150
3759,"They do get minorly uncomfortable after about an hour straight of them being on, but then again what headphones don't!",150
3760,If you are looking for legit stereo sound without paying an outrageous amount these are for you.,150
3761,"Also the band sticks out from the back of my neck by about 1/2 "" so i can sit on a chair without the headphones getting pushed off my head.",150
3762,"I've had these for two days now, and I love them.",150
3763,This headphone isn't as loud as other competitors.,150
3764,The headphone's quality of sound is so great that I recommended this to my friend.,150
3765,"If this isn't a problem, this would be a good choice for  you.",150
3766,Would definitely recommend.,150
3767,I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them like beats etc.,150
3768,"(about 48 inches long)
The sound quality is decent, not professional quality obviously but not that horrible flat sound you get with many ear buds.",150
3769,This is a great pair of headphones.,150
3770,"Artic has a large LED, on/off light you can't miss.",150
3771,I'll definitely be buying these again!!,150
3772,Highly recommend.,150
3773,"After four years and no small amount of wear to the pads, these phones still sound as crystal clear as when I bought them.",150
3774,This was even better then the original one I had .,150
3775,I have no idea whether any of that is due to the headset or the cell phone I'm using.,151
3776,I either take them off or shift them so that they're hanging on the top part of my ear instead of the part of my ear connected to my head.,151
3777,"Regardless, the headphones produce studio quality sound and even though they were white and used, there was not one indication as far as discoloration goes that they were used at all.",151
3778,I've had other headphones like these in the past but I didn't expect anything more for cheap headphones.,151
3779,"What I like - inexpensive, fits comfortably, syncing easily with Apple products, inexpensive, lightweight, comes with bag, inexpensive, buttons are accessible, stays put while running, buttons are logical, and inexpensive.",151
3780,These are also pretty uncomfortable on your ears and becomes painful when worn for a long period of time.,151
3781,Highly recommend.,151
3782,These are nice but they don't fit that great for me.,151
3783,The sound wouldn't come out after that mishap.,151
3784,Can be comfortably worn for about 3 hours before the ear cushioning becomes flat and starts to hurt ear cartilage.,151
3785,The short synopsis is these items work fantastic!!!,151
3786,"Within 5 seconds use could see there is a very noticeable lag in audio and what the video is doing, a second or two delay.",151
3787,I guess I was expecting more from these with such high stars and how many people have bought and rated them.,151
3788,I also wear glasses.,151
3789,I loved them so much I wore them out.,151
3790,The battery lasts with average usage 10 or so hours.,151
3791,"Hopefully with further tweaking, the snugness of the fit and consistency of the audio quality can be improved in future models.",151
3792,I bought these headphones for $25 at a local hipster/nerd store that I frequent.,151
3793,I widely recommend the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Headphone.,151
3794,I use these earphones primarily for watching TV while exercising at the gym or to listen to video clips on the computer.,151
3795,I had these for a while till  bought some Skullcandy headphones and I gave these to my brother.,151
3796,I mostly wear these for work sitting at a desk and listening to audiobooks.,151
3797,The headphone are not the best in the world or even top of the line.,151
3798,Both product's signal range and charge times are similar.,151
3799,Niceb Bluetooth headphones.,151
3800,"What I would suggest the manufacturer for a future version is slightly better looks and amazing noice cancellation, I'd pay 60 dollars also!",152
3801,"I would try and ""return"" it but it says you can only return an UNOPENED item.",152
3802,I quickly discovered the wire was loose at the end connecting to plug.,152
3803,I also use these headphones when I'm on the computer; I've watched a few interviews online and it's interesting what background noises these headphones pick up.,152
3804,"If you're looking for cheap headphones with potentially great sound quality, you've found them.",152
3805,"- I don't care how cheap it is, if your product is not really noise canceling, do not advertise it as such.",152
3806,"If you're really poor, hold out until there's a sale on better headphones.",152
3807,The lows are not enhanced and the sound is overall very neutral.,152
3808,I would have liked if there was a slight gap or more of a curve.,152
3809,These headphones are very light and easy to transport.,152
3810,Loud if you want them to be.,152
3811,Only item I didn't like was that the headstrap is not adjustable.,152
3812,"Love the headphones, works well.",152
3813,For $25 bucks they're damn good.,152
3814,They go in the backpack with lunch box and everything else squished and squashed :-).,152
3815,This hurts after a short time.,152
3816,"I can actually hear the bass of my music thrumming now and have found myself getting startled occasionally, even, as they pick up softer sounds in the background of my music that I had not previously heard.",152
3817,"+ Build quality (headset)
Pretty good for $20.",152
3818,"I heart radio sounds good on it for the price of the headphones, don't have to give my phone to my wife anymore to watch incoming calls due to the in coming call feature.",152
3819,"The ear cups pivot to fold flat, and fit in the shallow drawer of my media cabinet.",152
3820,The ear padding gets really wet for me and feels slippery which creates an uncomfortable feeling.,152
3821,They have good sound for just listening to music or movies.,152
3822,Those without such issues or not looking for any noise blocking qualities will love these headphones.,152
3823,"They're not great for running with though, as they shift small amounts as you run making noise as the padding around the ears shifts.",152
3824,"Very good quality, just the right amount of bass and does cancel out background noise pretty well.",152
3825,Long term durability is questionable at best.,153
3826,I sleep with them and they don't get all tangled or bent.,153
3827,"Cons:
1. when walking the outside noise can be loader than the headset.",153
3828,"For $15 not bad, but most of these reviews are very deceiving.",153
3829,They feel cheap but you what you pay for.,153
3830,This is a terrible headphone!!!,153
3831,He hasn't complained about it yet Its been over 1 month.,153
3832,Kids can be turds.,153
3833,"If you actually know anything about sound reproduction, these are great headphones!",153
3834,Turn it up and jam!!!,153
3835,"I had the older vesion of these headphones and those were lightweight, and suprisingly, built like a tank.",153
3836,I would recommend either one and will most likey buy myself the Artic based on good base in any position.,153
3837,Headphone is very lightweight and confortable.,153
3838,"They don't bother your ears at all, and they sound great.",153

3840,"Sound, comfort ex.",153
3841,"I use them as my everyday ones now, and they are very comfortable.",153
3842,I also use them to listen to iHeart Radio from my iPhone.,153
3843,Volume and Track control right on the ear for great hands free use.,153
3844,"The sound cuts a bit if you're moving around a lot, I wore then as I mowed my lawn, but for the most part, 'they're okay.",153
3845,SONY consistently delivers good quality.,153
3846,"Comfortable, small, lightweight and unobtrusive.",153
3847,I would highly recommend these headphones without any reservations.,153
3848,Thought about trying others just to compare but had to stick with this great product at a great price.,153
3849,"as expensive but they are so fine, that you should just buy two.",153
3850,(maybe I'm not  pretentious enough or my hearing isn't as quality?,154
3851,These got through 4-5 days before they needed to be charged.,154
3852,The package was nice and not hard to unwrap.,154
3853,"After doing some research for the best headphone at the best value ($25 and below), we decided to purchase this pair of headphones.",154
3854,I was worried about the sound quality but there is bass and everything seems well balanced.,154
3855,Guess I'll never know that though.,154
3856,"If you want better quality headphones, I would suggest investing into something better.",154
3857,"Headband pads can be bought, but the hot water pipe insulation was all I had available at the time.",154
3858,"After four years and no small amount of wear to the pads, these phones still sound as crystal clear as when I bought them.",154
3859,One minor minor complaint for both models are the drivers for the bluetooth on computers needed to be updated for the headsets to work.,154
3860,"volume is great, although I cannot hear much when I am in the subway due to the noise but for the price I am very happy.",154
3861,"Songs that I've listened to for years, I can hear so clearly.",154
3862,"If you have a head larger than a 5 year old kid, buy something else!!!",154
3863,It has pretty long range too?,154
3864,I guess I should have paid more attention to the reviews before ordering.,154
3865,So I bought a pair for my wife.,154
3866,I got her the Motorola S11-Flex HD headset at the same time and she hasn't even tried that headset yet because she is so pleased with the Kinivo.,154
3867,Outstanding sound quality for the price and very comfortable to wear.,154
3868,I've had them for about 8 workouts now and they've been great!,154

3870,"Everything else is great, pairs easily, buttons work well, functions as advertised.",154
3871,The only thing it's missing is bass but other than that the sound is clear.,154
3872,I purchased these to use as hands free calling.,154
3873,"The Sony ZX100 Over-the-Ear headphone with 30mm driver has about 24 ohms of resistance, requiring 50% more power to operate, but produces a more crisper sound response.",154
3874,These have a really good sound for the price.,154
3875,"It drives me crazy whenever it's visible to me, so I can imagine how annoying it must be for people around me.",155
3876,"No more charge, no more factory reset.",155
3877,I wear them to the gym.,155
3878,I have to buy a second one becuase i broke the wire to the left speaker,155
3879,The 10-hour rating for battery life seems right.,155
3880,Pairing is very easy.,155
3881,"Also, the volume is great for me and it works well with my hearing aid.",155
3882,"Also the band sticks out from the back of my neck by about 1/2 "" so i can sit on a chair without the headphones getting pushed off my head.",155
3883,"They do get a little uncomfortable after extended wearing, but it's not a deal breaker.",155
3884,"Cons:
 - Although they were comfortable, they hurt my ears after prolonged wear.",155
3885,"The louder you set the volume, the shorter the battery life.",155
3886,I bought one of these 2 years ago.,155
3887,I am sure it would work fine if I wanted music playing on it the entire time.,155
3888,The biggest gripe I have with them is just how NOT loud they are.,155
3889,"When you listen to any song, you can occasionally hear background instruments or percussion very well, this can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the way you view your music.",155
3890,"Not sure how to resolve that, at least it connects to my phone without issue.",155
3891,Arrived earlier than expected.,155
3892,I have to buy a second one becuase i broke the wire to the left speaker,155
3893,I read some of the reviews about these headphones before buying them.,155
3894,They looked comfortable and were made by Sony which is a tried and true brand that I completely trust.,155
3895,"I mean, I am talking after a couple hours it starts getting a little annoying with the plastic pressing on the top of your head.",155
3896,These headphones are comfortable enough that I can have them on for hours without experiencing any discomfort.,155
3897,"As for ambient sounds, when you are wearing them, they are a bit muffled, but not blocked.",155
3898,"They are very comfortable and they are Sony, a name brand.",155
3899,I used 22mm stuffed into each earpad.,155
3900,Also volume is good.,156
3901,"I had to replace them, not because they stopped working, but because I broke them trying to remove the hard plastic bar that wraps around the back of the head.",156
3902,This is my recommendation.,156
3903,"Cons
- Slight rattle - I own a couple of pairs of these headphones.",156
3904,And they are so much cheaper!,156
3905,"Low cost, low quality.",156
3906,"I would NEVER buy the Beats for two hundred dollars, these work just fine.",156
3907,"Now it's better than new because the cable is longer,  and better quality than the flimsy cable it came with.",156
3908,"I say, if you want brand A quality then buy brand A.",156
3909,I would like to know if any recalls are available for this item!,156

3917,I only read the negative reviews so I could find out the quirks that most users found with them.,156
3918,My happiness scale goes all the way up when I listen to music through these.,156
3919,People mistook them for Beats headphones at first.,156
3920,"So, if you need a pair of ""Headphones"" but you ""Ain't got a lot of money"", then check these out!!",156
3921,"Not only is the sound quality excellent (again, not compared to Sennheiser or other premium brands), but they are also amazingly durable.",156
3922,"My two biggest issues are that when I am listening to music via my Macbook and open a new browser tab, the music gets completely distorted for 10-15 seconds.",156
3923,It's pretty darn gross.,156
3924,I'm not sure if its the brand or where I got it from but BUYER BEWARE!,156
3925,Decent build...they are plastic and I'll have to be gentle with them.,157
3926,"Other than that, I think that they are great.",157
3927,"I would suggest buying these first, they're great for classical music, rock, and metal.",157
3928,I recommend these most highly.,157
3929,I go through headphones very quickly (three or four pairs in the last year).,157
3930,"Could use a little wider volume range, but for the price, it's an AWESOME product!",157
3931,"edit:
the headphones only work on 1 ear now.",157
3932,When I got them I fell in love with them.,157
3933,"that I woke someone up by calling them at a bad hour, I knew these were unacceptable.",157
3934,"They pair easily, rarely skip even for a second and have a very decent range (25-30 feet).",157
3935,"I thought she was old enough for this style rather than just ear buds, and for the cost of a modest set of buds, these are really good-sounding, well-designed headphones.",157
3936,Highly recommend to those who have budget around 15-20 bucks.,157
3937,"Overall they are probably better for ST listening, not something you could fall asleep in.",157
3938,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,157
3939,Built quality is sub par and very disappointing emotions.,157
3940,"This is a wonderful product for me, as I where hearing aids and can't wear in-the-ear bluetooth.",157
3941,The lows are not enhanced and the sound is overall very neutral.,157
3942,They look like they belong with the iphone super good looking and solid Sony quality.,157
3943,Perhaps this product is not designed to be paired with more than one item at a time.,157
3944,I highly recommend!,157
3945,"While not a Bose or those other HD headphones for the price range, I don't think you'll see much better value.",157
3946,Surprise--there are differences.,157
3947,I recommend these as a good-looking pair to wear in public.,157
3948,A great buy and would recommend.,157
3949,These look odd on me so I wear mine alone.,157
3950,"For the price you're paying, you're probably not going to get much better quality than this, that said, there are a few issues, namely, no volume control on the headset itself, sometimes sound is a little weird til you tinker with the cord.",158
3951,They've toned down the strength of it.,158
3952,"Anyway I was looking for the dj style that covers the ears and provide at least some noise reduction, for under 20 doll-hairs.",158
3953,"Chord is long too, and really good to use this on the treadmill.",158
3954,"For the price of these headphones, they're actually pretty good.",158
3955,"Really good for my four year old, ladted 6 monthes, for the price vs. abuse it was a great deal.",158
3956,These seem to have some static and a distinct lack of bass.,158
3957,"Thanks for reading,
ecl1pse
ecl1pse.bandcamp.com (I make music)",158
3958,They work great when placing phone calls as well.,158

3960,"The customer service for this product is outstanding and do the right job to get the job
done in time.",158
3961,"Anyway, with all the other headphones at the same price range that exist out there, I just returned them and bought something else.",158
3962,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,158
3963,You should be fine if you're only going to do light use.,158
3964,"Either that, or I have abnormally large and sensitive ears.",158
3965,"I bought them to replace my regular earphones, and my first impression was that they are really good.",158
3966,"The portion that wraps around your ear can get a little sore and annoying after a while, but just a little adjusting and it will go away.",158
3967,"Otherwise, it's a solid pair for the price!",158
3968,"Great product here, Kinivo!",158
3969,I purchased one set each for my boys to go with their tablets.,158
3970,"Also, it creaks and it doesn't feel like a quality craftsmanship.",158
3971,"Excellent head phones..In fact I still have them after 5 years,ear padding is a bit worn out but the sound is still so good..",158

3974,I kept getting the cord of the cable wrapped around my chair or hooked on something.,158
3975,"Long range, good sound, decent battery.",159
3976,A co-worker just bought a set for herself.,159
3977,"Overall, I highly recommend them for the average listener, but not for the audiophile snob types.",159
3978,I specifically wanted pure white headphones (that one little red line doesn't bother me; it helps me distinguish right v. left ear),159
3979,I bought this color and the white one for my kids that last longer than other brands.,159
3980,The MDRZX100 are going to a trash bin.,159
3981,The wiring by the headphone jack is getting a bit frayed on the inside so sometimes the sound is spotty but I'm not surprised.,159
3982,Don't buy these.,159
3983,"The chord was a bit shorter than I would prefer, but other than that it's fine.",159
3984,But they get the job done.,159
3985,"They are comfortable and deliver great sound, but the cord is a smidge short and doesn't allow much freedom of movement.",159
3986,"Alas, they did not.",159
3987,They are painful if you wear them very long.,159

3989,"This headphones are very comfortable for extended periods of use, I use them watching movies and they stay in place well with no discomfort to your ears.",159
3990,"For that reason, and for the fact that I wanted a better sound experience, I got on the hunt for good headphones.",159
3991,"Contrary to other reviewers, I did not find them to be so comfortable for long periods.",159
3992,Very comfortable to wear even with long hear flowing over.,159
3993,Shocked at the Sony quality.,159
3994,Money well spent!,159
3995,I've changed the rating to the 5 stars this replacement pair deserves.,159

3997,they fold up and fit nicely in his backpack.,159
3998,I enjoyed very much this pair of headphones.,159
3999,Arrived very quickly.,159
0,I think they look stylish...we'll see if they agree.,160
1,"Typically, I have my iPhone in my pocket or on the desk I'm sitting at or in the space on the treadmill where you set down your devices.",160
2,These are great for working out and stay snug on your ears.,160
3,I've bought some headphones that pressed against my ears too much and made me uncomfortable and some other headphones that couldn't take a beating and broke down too fast.,160
4,"For the price these are the best wireless headphones I have ever found, the battery lasts for weeks, the sound quality is good, and the on headphone volume and song scroll controls are quite responsive.",160
5,Oh mey gerd...I ordered a pair of headphones and guess what I got?!,160

7,I plan on taking better care of these.,160
8,WIll deal with again,160
9,I can't hold the ipod in my hand all the time.,160
10,"They are not noise canceling and they don't block much sound out, which is fine unless you are in a noisy environment.",160
11,"Sounds like a $50 pair of headphones, not a $15...VERY worth it.",160
12,"Appear a bit cheaply made, I think the all-black selection may look better than this red/black color, but it isn't horrible - not garish.",160
13,I am not happy with them.,160
14,The are a little small (I have a big head) but the fit.,160
15,Great sound and hopefully durable for the long haul!,160
16,"back on they go...she is disabled so i,m glad to have  something of good quality that she gets so much joy from,  and at a reasonable price,  thanks again.",160
17,"So I can hear cars coming, but it doesn't interfere with my music.",160
18,I own a pair I bought two years ago in-store.,160
19,Because I really like the headphones a LOT!,160
20,"Looks great, sound quality is good, somewhat above average, but ear coverage is minimal, could easily (inexpensively) be and so should be larger, and I found the cord to be too short.",160
21,"Dont know why, but the microphone didn't work...",160
22,You would be disappointed.,160
23,"For the cost of these, you just can't go wrong.",160
24,I've had these headphones for over a year and the battery life is still great.,160
25,"With those few cons in mind, they produced admirable sound quality, paired easily and never lost connection with my phone, and most importantly don't have cords and stayed on my ears!",161
26,I sweat too dam much and these have held up pretty good.,161
27,I think that for the average person who listens to pop or rock will  get the right kick out of these.,161

29,"My light never dims, and the power never comes on when I unplug and hit the power on button.",161
30,First time listening to it for a bit wasn't too impressed.,161

32,These headphones are very light and easy to transport.,161
33,Worked for about 5 months before dying.,161
34,The cord is fairly large so it doesn't get tangled and it very durable.,161
35,UPATE: Their customer service notified me after reading this review and sent me a new paid to replace the pair with the power issue.,161
36,Thinner would be better.,161
37,"I got some earbuds after that, but honestly I hate them more than anything, so I was so happy when I found these on Amazon.",161
38,"For the price these are the best wireless headphones I have ever found, the battery lasts for weeks, the sound quality is good, and the on headphone volume and song scroll controls are quite responsive.",161
39,I was searching high and low for bluetooth wireless headphones to use with my iPhone and iPod.,161
40,I don't understand why it don't work.,161
41,"What we got was impressive sound (sure a set of $300 headphones probably sound a little better, but not much), and impressive durability.",161
42,They still work as well as they did the day I got them.,161
43,MUSIC / CALL AUDIO QUALITY : The sound quality is very much acceptable considering the price you pay for this.,161
44,After looking for a while Igave up and just bought cheap... WELL little did I know that they would be just what I wanted.,161
45,Beats are overrated in my opinion and the quality that Sony offers is top notch and these headphones are a reflection of that.,161
46,"In addition, they are bulky and don't allow for leaning on anything.",161
47,Overall solid headphones nd great value for the price.,161
48,I have not got to the end of the battery yet and I pretty much use it all day long so it has great battery life.,161
49,Quality Headphones for the money.,161
50,The okay: I must have small ears.,162

57,"When they arrived, with other things that I had ordered, the headphone package was open, the edges of it were all worn and torn.",162
58,"When they work, they're fine, but they seem to lose their charge too quickly.",162
59,These are not bad headphones for the price.,162
60,"But as they are, I cannot recommend them.",162
61,It is very annoying.,162
62,Keep looking guys & gals.,162
63,The controls are very intuitive.,162
64,"As I was saying, these headphones are fantastic because they are very light weight and good quality.",162
65,then you'll be fine.,162
66,"The sound is crisp, bass is not drowning and it doesnt have hollow sound where voice and music sound separated.",162
67,Due to the headphones being smaller than my head I feel that the joints of these three pieces that make up the headband are going to snap on me as they do not feel durable.,162
68,"They're small and would be a great size for a child, the sound quality is ok, it sounds a bit low and the bass isn't much, it doesn't sound like the 20$ sony headphones, this pair would be a step down from that.",162
69,They just last song long.,162
70,Best investment ever!,162
71,These are very nice.,162
72,Excellent value for your dollar.,162
73,Item shipped and was delivered quickly.,162
74,Plenty loud enough for most users and insanely long battery life.,162
75,"Love the no cord aspect, fits great has wonderful sound quality.",163
76,I just wish they included a carrying case so i could just throw it in my backpack.,163
77,"You can bring these up to passable by boosting the treble, but if you're using a device that has no EQ control beyond bass boost they're going to sound very muffled

The insulating pads.",163
78,The sound is very good.,163
79,"I don't ever review, but these headphones are worth it.",163
80,"Overall, if the point is to listen to music, fine.",163
81,"Gave it to my 2 year old so she could use it with her ipad, I'll order a different headphones for gaming.",163
82,"Read the description before you buy it then get it then complain about it not being noise canceling, these weren't made to cancel out noise, just slightly muffle them out.",163
83,Usually I'm lucky if they last 6 months.,163
84,I can leave my phone on the kitchen counter and still stay connected in the basement or upstairs.,163
85,These earphones are good but I wish they didn't feel so tight.,163
86,"Also, nobody mentionned it, a (very) short limited warrantly of 90 days is provided.",163
87,You simply can't go wrong with a Sony product.,163
88,"When I listen to all my favorite song's the  sound's on this Sony stereo headphone's are great you can hear the music more,it tune's out any other sound around you.",163
89,"So, these are decent for the price and for style which is what I prefer (ie neckband with full ear muff).",163
90,They ended up being a little hard to hear since they don't block out background noise.,163
91,I have yet to run out of battery before a recharge.,163
92,These don't fit extremely well on my gigantic (7 7/8) head.,163
93,So I rate 4 stars.,163

95,Highly recommended!,163
96,They are great and he loves them.,163
97,"Quality of the voice calls - not sure about that, but people hear me.",163
98,*Comfortable Secure Fit.,163
99,"I have an above-average size head, I'm a husky 6'-2"", but come on, I'm no freak - the product should at least be adjustable to fit me.",163
100,Only thing that is on the bad side (and it may be a similar problem with other headphones) is how to keep the cord tied down to the headphones when not in use.,164
101,They are great.,164
102,"They are not noise canceling and they don't block much sound out, which is fine unless you are in a noisy environment.",164
103,I am looking forward to the increased time I can use the headphones (up to 10 hours?),164
104,I need a little tighter fit to make them a 5 star rating.,164
105,These are great quality for such a low price.,164
106,This is my second Kinivo and I absolutely enjoy it.,164
107,I now feel like I have either an oversized head or ears.,164
108,I tried to like these.,164
109,"So far i used to watch movies, video studying in the middle of the night without waking my roommate.",164
110,"At first I thought this was perhaps my wifi as I was streaming music, but subsequently I tried with music stored locally on my phone and had the same results, so it appears it is indeed the bluetooth connection.",164
111,"Fortunately, someone at Motorola must have foreseen this and engineered these rings that snap off of the earphone, allowing you to wrap the foam over them, and clip them right back on; amazingly increasing longevity.",164
112,Getting a second set for my daughter.,164
113,Built quality is sub par and very disappointing emotions.,164
114,"Next is the sound, which is very good.",164
115,I now feel like I have either an oversized head or ears.,164
116,My original pair of BTH240's were great.,164
117,"If the comfort were improved so I didn't have it hurting my ears, I would have no hesitation recommending it to others.",164
118,"They aren't audiophile headphones, but they are more than adequate; moreover, I don't have to switch headsets if I'm in a meeting and then want to drown out the office noise with music after the meeting is over.",164
119,I recently went running with these headphones on and yes it was charging the whole day.,164
120,"Needless to say, I am returning this item.",164
121,I did think that the range would be better.,164
122,..All at 20 dollars?,164
123,They are also very comfortable to wear.,164
124,"So anyway the gadget is great, but I needed some headphones.",164
125,I prefer these over the Jay bird 2s that cost $170.,165
126,"So when these were on sale, I figured why not try them.",165
127,I'm not an audiophile.,165
128,"Sound is good, far from perfect but what were you expecting for this price?",165
129,"As the subject says, the poor audio cable caused crackling on the slightest movements.",165
130,I took a chance and it paid off.,165
131,"Works fine, but not satisfied with quality.",165
132,Highly recommended for anyone who wants something good that will last.,165
133,Great item for the price.,165
134,"For use with my IPad, the volume is a little low even at the max when watching Netflix.",165
135,The first pair are about 2 years old and still going strong.,165
136,I will be returning them.,165
137,I wasn't looking to match the sound of my top of the line wired units but I was very pleased when these arrived and I put them to use.,165
138,"Be aware though the cord is around 3', so you'll need to either buy an extension if you need a longer distance or buy another brand entirely.",165
139,It remembers the last 5 devices you paired with so once I have paired with all of my devices it will be a piece of cake to pair.,165
140,They had offered to send me out a new pair.,165
141,There was no reason to by the DRE.,165
142,"I like them, so I will probably continue to use them, but i wish they were more comfortable.",165
143,A great buy and would recommend.,165
144,I can also attest that in the winter they actually keep your ears warm!,165
145,I have been wanting bluetooth headphones for my computer but didn't know how they worked.,165
146,"I am about to purchase a black for my boyfriend actually,
because I don't want his hands on mine lol",165

148,I'll use them 5-8hrs a week then charge them.,165
149,I've bought these headphones like 4 times in a row now.,165
150,"The range is good, the price was great, and they sound quality is nice.",166
151,Absolutely horrible.,166
152,You're not going to meet those expectations with a whopping $15.,166
153,There is about a half inch of space between the back portion of the headphones that are suppose to rest on the back of your head.,166
154,Sony you should be ashamed!!!,166
155,I've owned a pair for over three years now.,166
156,Cops have showed up at my house to verify if everything is okay.,166
157,There are both coach style buses and city style buses on my route and I'm able to hear over both.,166
158,Not sure how long they will last as they feel flimsy;time will tell.,166
159,Headset was portable and folded and it included a micro-usb cable and a microfiber carrying pouch.,166
160,This last pair has lasted for over a year.,166
161,Sony has had a great reputation for years but it is in decline.,166
162,Sound not too bad though but won't recommend for training.,166
163,They fold up nicely.,166
164,"Since these are on-ear headphones and are not noise cancelling, they do not really keep outside noise out, especially if you're on a plane or around noisy people.",166
165,They connect to all my devices.,166
166,It's so damn uncomfortable.,166
167,I love using these when I work out since it allows me to answer phone calls.,166
168,"So, I figured since I was happy with Sony, that would be the place to look.",166
169,They're adjustable and they still fit my tiny head.,166
170,"They are not really noise cancelling, but are effective and comfortable.",166
171,The sound is amazing and clear and they are extremely comfortable even after wearing them for hours.,166
172,I use my Kinivo headphones every day on the way to work and during my clerical day where all I do is data entry.,166
173,Light weight and good sound quality (it's no Bose but decent for the price).,166
174,"I really like the red color in the right side, that makes it look nice.",166
175,I use these for lectures and listening to music and it serves its purpose well.,167
176,"The actual headphones function well but if you have a giant head like me, they won't be very comfortable.",167
177,"Great sound quality, definitely 10/10
2.",167
178,"The range is good as well, compared to my previous headphones by Active.",167
179,"The only reason I am giving one start less is, I want to know how much battery life is still remaining in the headset, which I can't see.",167
180,The build isn't the best.,167
181,"Dont know why, but the microphone didn't work...",167
182,They aren't amazing by any means and at times seems a little fuzzy.,167
183,Sony's MDR-ZX100's are amazing.,167
184,I went a whole week using them without having to recharge.,167
185,They are very comfortable.,167
186,"At this moment, I am listening to music on my GNote with this headset and I am hearing both excellent treble and bass.",167
187,I purchased these based on the reviews but ended up very disappointed and returned them.,167
188,I have used these headphones on several runs and in the gym a few times now and I must say that I am quite impressed.,167
189,A really decent pair of headphones at a budget-minded price.,167
190,these headphones have very good sound quality for the price.. they are comfortable and hardly weigh anything.. the white color stands out and it looks sweet.,167
191,I love the kid but I really love those ATH-50's and I'm not willing  to make the sacrifice on this particular subject.,167
192,"My older cousin, who knows a lot about headphones, said these sound better than her $70 headphones.",167
193,The cushioning around the ear is also very comfortable as well.,167
194,"I might be a little concerned about the ear pieces fabric fraying because of sweat, but as long as the sound stays good I don't much care.",167
195,The problem is they feel too small for my fat head and they are not adjustable.,167
196,Overall 4.5/5 compared to all headphones Ive ever owned which says alot!,167
197,I have a feeling I could slice open the cable and find a loose connection somewhere.,167
198,I've had mine for over 6 months and I haven't had a single problem!,167
199,Headphones will not pair with my computer.,167
200,"When my daughter saw it the first time, she wants it because it matches with her Sony Laptop and now I had to order another one because I need one.",168
201,I would have liked if there was a slight gap or more of a curve.,168
202,"I wasn't about to pay $200 for a pair of Beats for her, these look nice, and work very well for the price.",168
203,Overalls great set if having chords is really not possible for you,168
204,It matches my white Sony Vaio too which is a plus.,168
205,but i figure thats a given with the behind the ear.,168
206,"Comfortable, great for bike riding, fits with helmet.",168
207,"great product i strongly recommend it, shiped very very fast it came in a day ahead, also it paired at once the voume is great and I use it on my galaxy 8 tablet",168
208,Good set of headphones for the price.,168
209,Pairing it to any bluetooth phone is easy.,168
210,The sound on these headphones is great.,168
211,so why would i rate this thing 5 stars?,168
212,"the pros:
1) light
2) good sound
3) good price
4) I can wear them with glasses doesn't bother me.",168
213,"If you need a pair for only 1 year, these are fine but don't expect to use them for 3 or more years, because they will disintegrate on your head",168
214,For the price i paid i was actually not expecting the quality that came out of the speaker.,168
215,Luckily the main box was fine and nothing was broken.,168
216,They are great for working out as well; just make sure you wipe them clean when you towel off since they are not waterproof.,168
217,Very comfortable to wear even with long hear flowing over.,168
218,They sound good and block out quite a bit of the surrounding noise.,168
219,"Panasonic RP-HT21, no question, every single time.",168
220,The headphones looked nice but no matter what I tried I could not get sound in both right and left sides.,168
221,Sounds are well reproduced with full bass and high trebles.,168
222,These sound horrible and Sony should make the design engineer wear ribbons of shame.,168
223,They bounce just slightly when on a run but will not fall off.,168
224,The only negative thing I can say about the headphones at this time has to do with the rubber piece covering the charging plug.,168
225,I have a small head for a guy and these are just big enough.,169
226,"As usual, the cord seems to be about 6 inches shorter than I need.",169
227,Without disputing the sound quality they are definitely not over the ear and the Amazon site provides an inadequate description.,169
228,$15 for over the ear headphones is a good price.,169
229,"But, they just mean you can hear the cord moving when the headphones are on, and it's not even a problem.",169
230,"Had them for 3 weeks now, using them a couple of hours a day, 5 days a week and I just now had to charge them since my first charge.",169
231,The package was nice and not hard to unwrap.,169
232,"What we got was impressive sound (sure a set of $300 headphones probably sound a little better, but not much), and impressive durability.",169
233,I probably got a lemon.,169
234,NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL and not adjustable.,169
235,"Actual, serious physical pain and burning of my ears.",169
236,They are comfortable.,169
237,"They are comfortable, and drown out sound pretty well.",169
238,"I had a pair of Koniva bth220, (which is an awesome pair) of bt headphones but they got ran over.",169
239,I let a friend borrow those so decided to get a second pair.,169
240,"You can bring these up to passable by boosting the treble, but if you're using a device that has no EQ control beyond bass boost they're going to sound very muffled

The insulating pads.",169
241,The sound quality was horrible and I hated having them in my ear.,169
242,The cord is long enough for me.,169
243,"They never break on the band, so they are sturdy...though I do take great care with my headphones as much as possible.",169
244,I have forgotten a few times and it lasted an additional week.,169
245,"The white ones are nice in appearance and I liked the red stripe on the right hand side, which makes knowing which side is which very easy at a glance.",169
246,I will be echoing the sentiments of many.,169
247,"I haven't tried running with these on, but I doubt they'd move at all.",169
248,"I don't expect bose quality on a $30 pair of headphones, but they are pretty darn good!",169
249,Higher quality and a higher price to match.,169
250,I was so pleased that I purchased three (two black and one white).,170
251,Will not be purchasing this model again.,170
252,"- Portability, the BTH240's fold up nicely and slip into the included cloth bag easily.",170
253,I got this product around Christmas and  has served me really well so far.,170
254,I would have given it 5 stars.,170
255,These are Sony and at about $15 it's a steal so I went a head and got them.,170
256,I can't understand how these are so highly rated.,170
257,It was delivered on time and came in good condition so I'm overall okay with it.,170
258,Not suitable for running at all.,170
259,"No more charge, no more factory reset.",170
260,The headband is way too rigid and totally uncomfortable.,170
261,Either girls or guys can wear them and they look really good on-- definitely look MUCH more expensive than they are.,170
262,I was mad but when I put on the head phones I was very happy!,170
263,freq response very good considering the low price.,170
264,I can't use them if I am trying to work on stuff beside my computer.,170
265,"When you need to block out the background sounds of dorm life or the city while you're doing your own thing, these headphones do a wonderful job with general noise.",170
266,Turned out to be a Win-Win!,170
267,Outstanding product.,170
268,"They sent out a replacement BTH240 immediately, but I had the same problem with it.",170
269,One star only because there's no negative.,170
270,With in the fist week I had them the right speaker blew for no reason and when I called to get the exchanged the customer service sucked so bad I hung up right in the middle of it,170
271,This is actually the second pair of these that I've purchased.,170
272,People mistake it from dre.,170
273,Call quality is surprisingly good.,170
274,They are very lightweight and fit over my ears well.,170
275,"My feedback isn't on the sound quality, just that the ears pieces are an awkward size and really uncomfortable for me.",171
276,I have used these headphones on several runs and in the gym a few times now and I must say that I am quite impressed.,171
277,I doubt I'll need to any time soon.,171
278,I love listening to music and these headphones are comfortable...The sound quality is very good.,171
279,Overall it's a good product.,171
280,I was cleaning the walls of my house.,171
281,For the price these are a great buy.,171
282,It is like they were made for kids?,171
283,I used this when I was running.,171
284,Got for my boys for Christmas.,171
285,Good quality earphones.,171
286,"Not as ""fancy"" as beats quality headphones, material is definitely on the cheaper side.",171
287,I have an app on my phone with an equalizer and played around with the sound settings.,171
288,First time listening to it for a bit wasn't too impressed.,171
289,"He loved the design and thought the sound was good, but this past week it stopped working.",171
290,"But if you're like me and would rather not spend hundreds of dollars on headphones, these work just fine.",171
291,"The thing I love is that there very durable, My little nephew bash them 2 times with a baseball bat, and not a single scratch!",171
292,They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these).,171
293,"In their backpacks to listen to music on the bus, at school for various classes, out of the backpack when they were home and countless times of falling asleep with them on, and rolling over onto them in their sleep.",171
294,"I don't personally have any complaints because for the price, they are very good sounding headphones.",171
295,"The frame is light, sturdy, and well-designed for everyday use.",171
296,It is way worse with the Watch.,171
297,Love the feature that they fold flat for easy storage.,171
298,Sound is pretty good for under $30.,171
299,"THE PAIR in question even with the mentioned issues, play perfectly fine out of both sides and still sound pretty damn good ...",171
300,I was nervous about the volume being too low since everyone was talking about noise cancelation type stuff but I use them and can't hear a thing besides my music and that's all I could ask for!!,172
301,The bass is just awesome.,172
302,These look and feel nice for the price.,172
303,They're just not for me.,172
304,"When still, it works flawlessly.",172
305,"Lightweight, feels comfortable around ears, and provides above-average sound for the price.",172
306,"Overall they are probably better for ST listening, not something you could fall asleep in.",172
307,"The only downside is the lack of microphone, and fact that they don't fold up as nicely as other pairs.",172
308,I have issues with headphones and I seem to go through a lot of them but I've had these for several months now and they are really perfect to me.,172
309,All in all I think it's a great product for the price,172
310,The cable and plug are also very sturdy.,172
311,"If you're really poor, hold out until there's a sale on better headphones.",172
312,I had already purchased the Kinivo BTH3 headphones for at work and wanted an economical solution for those random times when I just want to get away from all the other noises at home and focus on my computer.,172
313,these headphones have very good sound quality for the price.. they are comfortable and hardly weigh anything.. the white color stands out and it looks sweet.,172
314,"So all the similarities are there, someone said the size of these protruding are smaller than others but i found them to be the same.",172
315,"Otherwise, it's a solid pair for the price!",172
316,For a low end headphone the plastic is very sturdy and solid.,172
317,I use them everyday in the gym.,172
318,For the money you can't go wrong.,172
319,things that i like and dislike are.,172
320,I went back to using my $20 wired headphones.,172
321,So if you're looking for bass you can literally feel (like many headphones provide) these are not for you.,172
322,"The size of the speakers (the part that goes on your ear) is a little smaller than I anticipated, but they do tell you the size of the headphones before you buy.",172
323,Bought them as gifts for directors who were competing at a marching band event and they loved them!!!,172
324,This wasn't a bad sound--if you like blues and jazz this set would be good with that warm sound.,172
325,"They might be good for children, or as a spare pair, but I wouldn't recommend them for your primary set of headphones.",173
326,I bought it almost one year ago and have been wearing them to gym and outdoor cycling.,173
327,"This is my second pair of Kinivo headset, I own the BTH220 and the BTH240 is a nice upgrade, buttons feel much better.",173
328,My eight and six year old got them for Christmas and they use them all of the time.,173
329,Especially for those looking for a set of headphones to be used while exercising or running.,173
330,the 'ear pads' are really comfortable even when wearing them for a few hours.,173
331,I look forward to Kinivo's next model.,173
332,"The sound these headphones deliver, for a quarter of the price of my Grados, is fantastic.",173
333,"Respectable sound quality,  Decent base and mid-levels.",173
334,I like the headphones and they're reasonably good for sound.,173
335,I emailed the manufacturer about 3 weeks ago and no response.,173
336,"My only quibbles are the fit (they keep sliding off of my ears -- I have small ears and long hair that tucks behind my ears and I often wear the headphones and sunglasses at the same time, and the headphones won't stay on.",173
337,I also use them to watch Netflix on my iPad and it paired easily with my iPad 4th generation.,173
338,"On the downside, I have a wide face and normal human ears and it's a tight, somewhat uncomfortable fit.",173
339,All of the New Music I just down loaded sounded greater than I ever expected.,173
340,This seems to be common for a lot of these inexpensive headsets.,173
341,These headphones do the trick.,173
342,My sone broke his and we purchased another about a year ago.,173
343,The only thing it's missing is bass but other than that the sound is clear.,173
344,These were also a gift and my daughter loves them.,173
345,They don't really stay in place for me when I am working out and they do cause some slight discomfort behind the ears for me.,173
346,They where very comfortable and soft so I was very disappointed.,173
347,"Got them for my 9,13, and 14 year old nephews for christmas.",173
348,They cannot safely be tossed into the bottom a backpack.,173
349,"I used to use cheap wired headphones to listen to my podcasts, I would go through a pair a month, these have lasted me 8 months so it's a great value.",173
350,They do take a bit of getting use to getting them on your ears.,174
351,"But again, it lacks the hardshell protection from heavier objects.",174
352,Amazon made it easy for me though.,174
353,And that's what I mostly listen to.,174
354,I rarely use it.,174
355,"Fit to ear is comfortable, although it is little tight.",174
356,I would recommend these to anyone looking for bluetooth headphones at a decent price.,174
357,"And occasionally if my phone is buried deep in a pocket or a bag, it can be spotty with the bluetooth.",174
358,"I am not a professional dj, and nor is my daughter;)",174
359,"They arrived quickly, are simple and intuitive to use and sound good and last a good while before needing to be recharged.",174
360,I only gave the second star because it was so difficult to find headphones without that useless noise canceling.,174
361,Now the right one is starting to go out as well.,174
362,I was cleaning the walls of my house.,174
363,They sound better than competing headphones in the under $50 range.,174
364,"But actually, it is not!",174
365,"I'm considering the price range, I did not expect it to sound as good as a sennheiser but still it was a bit disappointing",174
366,I have a somewhat large head and do not find the BTH240 it be tight.,174
367,"Also, nobody mentionned it, a (very) short limited warrantly of 90 days is provided.",174
368,The padding on them makes them very comfortable.,174
369,If you just want to enjoy your music and want headphones that are durable get these instead.,174
370,I just gave that headset to my son when he went to college and bought the BHT240.,174
371,I guess I was expecting more from these with such high stars and how many people have bought and rated them.,174
372,Audio keeps repeatedly cutting out when there's a slight movement (e.g.,174
373,"I own a Kinivo Bluetooth adapter to use these headphones with my Windows PC, when using Skype and when my smartphone is connected to the PC.",174
374,"That, combined with a great many calls where the headset abruptly dropped connectivity with a loud ""PANG!""",174
375,Both sets died within a week of each other.,175
376,I dunno if Igot a bad one this time or not.,175
377,The bad: Maybe I have bigger ears but sometimes they take some fiddling to get comfortable on my head.,175
378,"Quality of the voice calls - not sure about that, but people hear me.",175
379,"However, under Ubuntu the microphone does not work, even when HSP profile is selected.",175
380,"You can pay a lot more but for a basic head set for your grand kids, this is the one.",175
381,Now if you're expecting a high end sterophile experience then look elsewhere.,175
382,"I'm a trained audio engineer, but I get that these are cheap-o headphones.",175
383,Only draw back is when they're on people can hear the music you're playing and I was looking for a pair of headphones that I can use while my son is napping or in the bed while I'm working during the wee hours.,175
384,"If you are a hi-fi head, you'll be disappointed with some of the range issues, but for the rest of us mere mortals, they are fantastic and give a true and clear sound.",175
385,"The Good:
Well built.",175
386,Fast delivery and great product.,175
387,"Eye Glasses, earbuds,  scarves.",175
388,I have a feeling I could slice open the cable and find a loose connection somewhere.,175
389,"Got what I wanted, nuff said.",175
390,I find myself wearing them for hours at a time.,175
391,So I'll use them until they inevitably break...which they quickly will given the crappy cords they're equipped with...and then I'll go to Best Buy and purchase some more real ones at a higher price.,175
392,It's easy to switch to accept or make a phone call.,175
393,These work just as well.,175
394,These would definitely be that product.,175
395,They have excellent sound quality and require very little charge time for a long playtime.,175
396,You're not going to meet those expectations with a whopping $15.,175
397,"Sound, comfort ex.",175
398,It's not like the professional ones but it is great quality for the price and it may just last longer for me than my Behringer ones that only lasted a year and I payed more for!,175
399,The sound quality isn't so good but the looks and brand name of Sony alone make up for it.,175
400,The only drawback was they weren't long enough to watch my tv from bed.,176
401,You can turn up the sound pretty loud and it sounds amazing.,176
402,It is hard for them to keep ear buds in their ears.,176
403,Great price for these headphones.,176
404,I own a pair I bought two years ago in-store.,176
405,I purchased these about 4 years ago and they just died.,176
406,2) The rubber door that covers the USB port is flimsy and fragile and won't stay closed.,176
407,My son goes through headphones like crazy.,176
408,"Also, the padding around the earpieces is quite comfortable and doesn't allow much sound leakage at all.",176
409,"I always tell it like it is, the bad along with the good.",176
410,These headphones are budget friendly.,176
411,"Even though I have a fairly small head, they are tight.",176
412,I find that I don't even realize that I am wearing them.,176
413,Received the headphones as stated on the order.,176
414,It is perfect for taking outdoors.,176
415,"My PC with Windows 8, allows me to chose my default sound source, either computer speakers, or the Kinivo headset.",176
416,"Im the kind of person that only uses earbuds but i got this because of the low price and how they look....But OMG when they came i was so happy,they work great,they are awesome!",176
417,I'm in love with these things.,176
418,"Update 3 Sep 15

They stopped working about a week ago.",176
419,I originally bought this for a friend since we skype a lot.,176
420,"This can happen even if I'm right next to my phone and outdoors, so I'm not sure if that eliminates the Bluetooth and cellular connections as the culprits.",176
421,I'm not concerned about them falling off.,176
422,I have some hearing deficit so it is much better to watch things on my Ipad with the headphones.,176
423,"The reason I don't score higher is this: cord does not separate from headphones, so if it goes, you have to replace all.",176
424,If it manages to stay connected audio becomes laughably out of sync.,176
425,"I am writing this after a couple of years of ownership, and I haven't used them for a long time, but I dug them out and tried them again.",177
426,The Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone exceeded my expectations.,177
427,"The connection to my phone is great, so I can have it in my bag instead of a pocket like with a wired set.",177
428,I've had these headphones for about 7 months and I love them.,177
429,"Not as ""fancy"" as beats quality headphones, material is definitely on the cheaper side.",177
430,"edit:
the headphones only work on 1 ear now.",177
431,I would rate more purchases but only bother to if I really like them or really hate them.,177
432,Sound is okay/cool and I love that the right side has a read mark so u can easily know what side to put where.,177
433,But maybe I am used to earbuds.,177
434,The only reason I bought these headphones was because I'm a broke college student who couldn't stand the soupcan sound of the iPhone earbuds anymore.,177
435,"Really good sound quality, and a fairly comfortable fit.",177
436,Stretching them out helps for a while but even the loosest setting was not enough for me.,177
437,I highly recommend it.,177
438,I would recommend it to everyone I meet.,177
439,Bought this product after seeing high reviews !!,177
440,"I would say that it is likely just do to the fact that I am small and have a narrow head, but it is still annoying none the less.",177
441,"They're not great for running with though, as they shift small amounts as you run making noise as the padding around the ears shifts.",177
442,All three are in great working condition and my kids do a good job of working them.,177
443,They fit so comfortably and nicely!,177
444,I did have some concerns about the comfort of the back neck piece however I do not even feel it most of the time.,177
445,the next time you go shopping.,177
446,I love sony headphones I have the white pair and I have the black pair now.,177
447,"Thought about Motorola, but went with Kinivo.",177
448,Haven't had anyone complain that they can't hear me while talking to them on it.,177
449,"I traveled with these, stuffing them in the most obscure places.",177
450,When these break I will buy another pair.,178
451,I did think that the range would be better.,178
452,Sony is a great brand got the white  color.,178
453,I am so happy with these and I sleep quite well.,178
454,And they are so much cheaper!,178
455,That didn't help.,178
456,(Which is more than I can say for may other brands.),178
457,The sound on these headphones is great.,178
458,"One Con:
I am working on finding the comfort factor for wearing them for extended periods as they go over the ears and rest on the back of my neck.",178
459,They're adjustable and they still fit my tiny head.,178
460,Pro- It works fine.,178
461,"My son loves this product, and it helps us not have to listen to him playing his video games on his computer.",178
462,That will be the only negative I could find with these headphones.,178
463,"Just like the price of these headphones, the quality is also low.",178
464,I even got a hug 3 days ago from the 9 year old for buying them.,178
465,I have finally found a set of wireless headphones that stay on my ears without being too bulky.,178
466,I've tried turning them up as loud as I could with volume on my iPhone and on the headphones and they still aren't that loud.,178
467,"Comfortable, small, lightweight and unobtrusive.",178
468,I suppose this thing is good for rock or rap...when deep bass pounding is wanted.,178
469,I would definitely recommend them!,178
470,I switched to these after trying Bluetooth earbuds because the buds did not stay in my ears even with minimum activity.,178
471,Can't wear for more than a few minutes unless I only keep it on one ear.,178
472,"It's not as long as my last set of headphones, which would probably be good for someone using them for anything other than what I use them for, which is sitting at my computer.",178
473,They've toned down the strength of it.,178
474,I would buy them again but my current ones don't look anywhere close to breaking.,178
475,Headphones fit my head.,179
476,I use them everyday in the gym.,179
477,"I do clean them every so often, so I don't know if it's just that they are dirty and making my skin itch, or if I am having an allergic reaction to the material.",179
478,I have worn these on an airplane and could hardly hear the jets.,179
479,These are just the ticket.,179
480,I highly recommend it.,179
481,"Amazing product regardless, though!",179
482,I was surprised how easy it was to set up.,179
483,I love that they fold and come with a storage bag which means it can be stored easily in my gym bag.,179
484,"They do get a little uncomfortable after extended wearing, but it's not a deal breaker.",179
485,"But i wish they weren't white, because it got dirty on the inside VERY quick.. Other than that, they were absolutley WONDERFUL",179
486,"I owned a similar pair of Sony headphones about ten years ago, and for the price there is no better pair that you can get.",179
487,The sounds is ok but not good/very good or excellent.,179
488,The packaging was opened when I received these headphones.,179

490,One hand operation.,179
491,WIll deal with again,179
492,I did have some concerns about the comfort of the back neck piece however I do not even feel it most of the time.,179
493,The sound is good and acceptable.,179
494,Best blutooth headphones I've purchased.,179
495,"If your going to buy these take care of them, if you don't then it will definitely break.",179
496,They could even add $2 to the price without ruining the great value of them.,179
497,People mistake it from dre.,179
498,"Three qualities are most important to me in any set of headphones: Durability, Sound Quality, and Comfort.",179
499,I think they're pretty good considering I only paid about $30 for them.,179
500,"If star ratings were correlated with price, this would be 5 stars.",180
501,These are also very nice looking & look more expensive than they are.,180
502,All in all I couldn't be happier and for the price it's a no brainer.,180
503,"If you're looking for a affordable and good quality headphone, I will recommend these headphones.",180
504,Wish these were water resistant like the ones Kinivo recently pulled from the market (don't know why) but all in all these are a very good choice for this kind of head phone.,180
505,"I have reviewed your order and am prepared to assist further.""",180
506,My reference system comprises Beyer Dynamic DT 990 Premium 600 OHM Headphones using Benchmark DAC1 to drive the Beyers.,180
507,"i was discussed with the sound quality of these headphones, Sony dropped the ball on these.",180

510,They fit comfortably and I use them at work in the office.,180

515,"For the price, the headphones are awesome!",180
516,got these headphones in like february.,180
517,The pink color is a little flatter and not as bright as you would think.,180

519,It also costed like 26 bucks.,180
520,Love this headphone that I bought 2 of them.,180
521,"I wish they were smaller, and I'd like a version that goes over the top of the head (instead of over the back).",180

523,I've bought Sony earbuds for about $10 that sound alot better and dynamic than these headphones.,180

525,"The only thing i didn't like , is how it was packaged.",181
526,"Thank God he doesn't know what ""Dre Beats"" are.",181

530,Inexpensive and works fine.,181

541,Only done side a little more bass would have been nice.,181

543,"Thought about giving this 3 stars but for the money, I just can't complain that much.",181
544,Sony has had a great reputation for years but it is in decline.,181

546,"And for $20, you can't go wrong.",181

550,Well the headphones weren't picking up on the sound when I was using it with any program on the PC.,182

552,But maybe I am used to earbuds.,182
553,Great headphones for $15.,182

567,I got a pair of MDR-NC7 for about what I paid for the MDR-ZX100s I'm reviewing here.,182
568,"So they are wireless and you can answer phone calls with them, what's better than that.",182
569,"However both clips have broken and I've had to duct-tape them back into place -- next stop, Krazy Glue.",182
570,I'm the type who I crank up my music and just dive into what I'm doing.,182
571,They are perfect for the gym.,182
572,I do not think that I will be buying another pair when (more like if) these die on me.,182
573,Before buying them I was a little hesitant based on reviews from other users on amazon.,182
574,"Regardless, they have been the longest lasting headphones I've ever owned.",182
575,Only and minor complaint is that the plastic band stretches .,183
576,It's neither good or bad.,183
577,They are very nice.,183
578,"Not too bad for $15-20 and of course not $200 Beats or Bose sounding, but At $20 I also have a pair of Sennheiser HD202s that blow these Sonys out of the water.",183
579,"They are small, really small.",183
580,"Chord is long too, and really good to use this on the treadmill.",183
581,Comfortable and they stay on my head very well.,183
582,"The sound is just okay, and I often have problems connecting this to my devices when I have to switch from my desktop to my phone.",183
583,"For around $20, the sound quality is excellent, and would certainly recommend these to anyone looking for a VERY GOOD set of headphones, that just happen to be inexpensive.",183
584,"I find these comfortable, contrary to some reviewers, I wear a 7 1/2 baseball type cap.",183
585,"If you want good headphones for a good price,You can't go wrong with these stylish headphones from Sony.",183
586,"First of all, the way these fold up makes them relatively easy to carry around, but they are still bulky, and prone to folding out again accidentally.",183
587,This is my second Kinivo and I absolutely enjoy it.,183
588,I have no idea how but there is really no way to untwist it.,183
589,"The sound is surprisingly good, the padding is comfortable, and they don't cost much.",183
590,"Build quality is great cord length is actually perfect comfort is excellent, but the sound quality is most important.",183
591,"But overall, it isn't too bad for the price.",183
592,"They are comfortable, block out outside noise, and have good audio quality.",183
593,SONY did a good job as a big brand should,183
594,I finally decided to look on Amazon and these looked highly recommended and for $25 I didn't think I was taking much of a risk.,183
595,"Also, the sound was really poor.",183
596,Lost them and re-ordered another.,183
597,I do occasionally get static when I'm downtown as if a stronger signal just temporarily overwhelmed my bluetooth connection and I have to back up 30 seconds on my audiobook to hear what I missed.,183
598,"I am writing this after a couple of years of ownership, and I haven't used them for a long time, but I dug them out and tried them again.",183
599,Just want I needed.,183
600,I now feel like I have either an oversized head or ears.,184
601,"Used them on my droid but can play them very lound for some reason, i believe it is my phone though.",184
602,Can't wait to go full force in the gym with these.,184
603,That may be the headphones or it may be the cellular signal where I'm at or where the listener is at.,184
604,I bought for my son to use during the time he watches the IPAD but it didn't last long enough.,184
605,"FINALLY, we have it!",184
606,"I use it when I'm gaming, doing homework, watching a movie in the Library, basically all the time.",184
607,"Love the no cord aspect, fits great has wonderful sound quality.",184
608,"The ear padding is very soft, and the headphones stay secure to your head without pressing in on your ears (which I find uncomfortable over long periods).",184
609,"The sound quality and the bass is very impressive, I might even purchase another one for a family member.",184
610,"Listen to the reviews and you'll know that this is not for someone who wants ""top of the line"" quality and base pounding headphones.",184
611,If I wanted something high end I would of paid high end money.,184
612,Not clear if you can use a cigarette lighter USB charger in car or truck to supply charging power to the headphone when out and about.,184
613,It seems to me that they last wayyyy longer than 10 hours.,184
614,Nothing sounds distorted or shrill.,184
615,(maybe I'm not  pretentious enough or my hearing isn't as quality?,184
616,Both product's signal range and charge times are similar.,184
617,I should have bought two of these.,184
618,"The first few weeks, after about 45 minutes, I felt some mild ear soreness.",184
619,"Looks great, sound quality is good, somewhat above average, but ear coverage is minimal, could easily (inexpensively) be and so should be larger, and I found the cord to be too short.",184
620,It's OK if you're not very picky about the sound of your music.,184
621,Like I don't even need to know that dude.,184
622,I was skeptical when I purchased these headphones because of the low price.,184
623,I prefer my in-ear jawbones for outside of gym.,184
624,"Fit, in terms of tightness on the head ( my hat size is 7 1/4 ) is a 6 on a 1 to ten scale.",184
625,I mention them only because they are on my wishlist.,185
626,I'll definitely be buying these again!!,185
627,My head is not particular bigger the other people.,185
628,this does not have that problem.,185
629,I usually only do it after shirts vs skins basketball games when I do an impromptu press conference or I Kanye Weat my pastor of the church to talk about Beyonce's gospel album.,185
630,That alone is worth 5-stars.,185
631,I purchased a headset before these for 11 dollars and the connection on those were beyond better than the kinivo set.,185
632,I would buy these again.,185
633,The headset works as I expected.,185
634,This is still applicable even during calls.,185
635,I'm just reviewing so the average Joe can know that these headphones are worth the $15 and that it is a great purchace.,185
636,I tried running with it but it just didn't work out for me since it wasn't as snug as a fit as I had wanted.,185
637,Works fine with the phone function and with Siri.,185
638,Great value and performance.,185
639,:)  These push against my cartilage after a while.,185
640,"I love, love, LOVE these headphones!",185
641,"Additionally, there appears to be a type of AVL (volume limiter) built into this product.",185
642,Once again Sony has proven to provide a good quality product for a very reasonable price.,185
643,Probably not ideal for kids but it still works.,185
644,There is about a half inch of space between the back portion of the headphones that are suppose to rest on the back of your head.,185
645,"Overall, I'm satisfied with them for the price they were.",185
646,"Things with lots of bass (movies, dance music) have good punch.",185
647,They sound great and have a nice base.,185
648,Perhaps someone reading this review will have an idea.,185
649,"they do hurt my ears if i wear them for too long, but they are my first pair of over ear headphones, so i could be wearing them weirdly, idk lol",185
650,The white makes them fun too.,186
651,Honestly should have just bought another pair of 220's.,186
652,Feels comfortable as well sometimes i forget they are on.,186
653,They are very nice.,186
654,Headphones arrived after long shipping timw with faulty wire.,186
655,"In terms of sound, I'd say that they are about the same quality.",186
656,"While I haven't used a measuring tape, I can easily walk around my entire fitness facility and never lose connection.",186
657,"Out of the box, quick connection to the phone and up for HOURS of great music.",186
658,"Not bad, was a little leary of buying them since they were so cheap but thought I'd try the out since they are Sony brand.",186
659,Also volume is good.,186
660,"These are very good headphones, overall.",186
661,I would recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of headphones for a good price even if he/she is not using them for running or other activities.,186
662,There is no clarity.,186
663,Went upstairs and into bedrooms and it worked clearly as it did standing next to it.,186
664,I've only given them a 4 star because I've only had them for 2 weeks :) we'll see how things go in the months to come :),186
665,"Love the headphones, works well.",186
666,"To me, the bass on these is perfect.",186
667,I got this in white for my girlfriend and she really loves them.,186
668,I don't think they are made to be waterproof.,186
669,I am so glad I made this purchase!,186
670,As far as the Phone quality.,186
671,The headphones themselves are very light and very comfortable on my head but the bad noise coming from the left speaker is always there.,186
672,I needed new headphones because my last pair (a different brand) started only to play in one ear which many headphones do to me since they take a lot of abuse from me.,186
673,The headphone's sound is clear and flat in the mid range and part of the high frequency range.,186
674,"Overall, I can't complain whatsoever about the sound quality.",186
675,Would definitely buy again.,187
676,The only feature they have is earpieces that cover the full ear canal opening to muffle external sound waves.,187
677,"i don't like it , because the cable is short , and it's not comfortable :( , a like the sound quality and weight , i shouldn't forget the price , for the price i think it's a nice choice .",187
678,I've bought some headphones that pressed against my ears too much and made me uncomfortable and some other headphones that couldn't take a beating and broke down too fast.,187
679,"I revised my review to 4 stars, would be 5 if the microphone worked better.",187
680,Much better than the Photive and low end Sony phones in my house.,187
681,I run treadmills and rid trains with this and can't care about anyone else's opinion about the brand because they don't know what perfection I'm listening to.,187
682,"Purchased in late May 2015 and just discovered it died, will not charge - I got about 18 months of use out of it, but really expected more for the price (around $25 at time of purchase).",187
683,I would definitely recommend them!,187
684,Cheap and effective.,187
685,You won't regret it!,187
686,It has very good bluetooth connectivity.,187
687,The sound quality is good.,187
688,I am returning this and will look for something better.,187
689,Not too shabby for the price dynamic range 8 out of 10 depends on the output of you're system at my age 40+ hendrix and clapton always sound like gods.,187
690,Received these for my 5 year old son.,187
691,Poor quality manufacturing all around.,187
692,"However they are definitely the best cheapest headphones I have ever used, and I will be buying the updated model from Sony.",187
693,They have a soft rubber cover over where the wire meets the male connector (i.e.,187
694,Though not flush it fits your ear well and is not loose.,187
695,"Over a year and still work, purchased Dec 2015 and still sound great.",187
696,Loud enough to hear over the mower and long enough to last a work day.,187
697,i say get them in black because they can get dirty but easy to clean.,187
698,"Also, the sound was fine, but wasn't near the quality of my $30 Sony headphones that were wired.",187
699,"I guess they are worth the 18 bucks, but not much more.",187
700,For a low end headphone the plastic is very sturdy and solid.,188
701,I love listening to music and these headphones are comfortable...The sound quality is very good.,188
702,"i been through some good times with these headphones, Thank God for putting these headphones in my life.",188
703,Which is why the 4  stars instead of 5.,188
704,"I'm pleased with the battery life, and charging them up is simple with any standard micro-USB charger.",188
705,You can turn up the sound pretty loud and it sounds amazing.,188
706,I bought these after years of wanting a pair of Bluetooth headphones and I am glad I did.,188
707,These are Sony and at about $15 it's a steal so I went a head and got them.,188
708,It is does not have noise reduction but since it is cheap it is worth it.,188
709,"For less than 20 dollars, SONY is SONY.",188
710,The battery lasts with average usage 10 or so hours.,188
711,Best headphones I've ever had and so inexpensive.,188
712,2) The headphones don't fit very snug.,188
713,On my PC when I want to use the headphones I just power them up and wait about 10 seconds or so.,188
714,I bought this headset to use with my Samsung Tablet.,188
715,The Artic seems better on the bass range.,188
716,"They sound great, and function intuitively.",188
717,"They worked well for his program, and they work well when listening to music as well.",188
718,Love this headphone that I bought 2 of them.,188
719,I bought these to replace a pair of soundbot bluetooth headphones I purchased about 10 months previously.,188
720,These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've owned.,188
721,"My first set was the BTH220, and I loved them so much I bought the 240.",188
722,I quickly discovered the wire was loose at the end connecting to plug.,188
723,The two sound differences these headphones have from the 150s are a) a slightly lower output and b) a slightly lighter bass.,188
724,"They were easy to connect to my iPad, and sound good and have pretty good range.",188
725,I have a feeling I could slice open the cable and find a loose connection somewhere.,189
726,"Also the band sticks out from the back of my neck by about 1/2 "" so i can sit on a chair without the headphones getting pushed off my head.",189
727,I had already purchased the Kinivo BTH3 headphones for at work and wanted an economical solution for those random times when I just want to get away from all the other noises at home and focus on my computer.,189
728,"For anyone that complains about the sound quality, THEY ARE $15.00.",189
729,"This worked fine, but I did replace it with an $80 Logitech.",189
730,A little staticky when touched by where you plug the cord in to your device.,189
731,The sound is really not to be beat for this price.,189
732,"My feedback isn't on the sound quality, just that the ears pieces are an awkward size and really uncomfortable for me.",189
733,All ambient noise will leak in and all noises created by the headphones will leak out.,189
734,The padding on them makes them very comfortable.,189
735,I got one for my self then got two more for family.,189
736,contacted kinivo's customer service and the rep emailed me a return label.,189
737,"Sound:
  Just bought a pair because I left my Alessandro MS-1s at home and am listenning now.",189
738,the sound quality seems good and the headphones have held up well to use.,189
739,"Couple of other folks have them, and they all gave me positive reviews which influenced my purchase even more.",189
740,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DESIGNED .,189
741,She would bang them on everything and drag them hanging from her tablet up the wood stairs everyday.,189
742,I love having buttons on the side so I don't need to be next to my phone.,189
743,"It might just be the pair I received, but the range on these are awful when in an open environment (i.e.",189
744,When they did work they did a decent job for the price but always had a rattling in the right ear and didn't block out much noise.,189
745,Update: The company contacted me.,189
746,It's a lifesaver!,189
747,"These headphones are built by amazingly, talented, under-aged Chinese slave children.",189
748,"Although the cord is a little shorter than I would like, it's still slightly longer than the cord on my Apple earbuds they replaced.",189
749,"So far, I don't have any complaints.",189
750,The sound is good as well.,190
751,It gets the job done for the price one thing that is annoying is that you have to pair it every time you use it you can't just turn on your bluetooth and go like others after pairing it the first time,190
752,But I knew this had to be just a bad unit.,190
753,I charge them about once a week if not less.,190
754,"It is not super quality, but for the price it is OK.",190
755,Arrived very quickly.,190
756,I've bought these headphones like 4 times in a row now.,190
757,Arrived earlier than expected.,190
758,"They aren't audiophile headphones, but they are more than adequate; moreover, I don't have to switch headsets if I'm in a meeting and then want to drown out the office noise with music after the meeting is over.",190
759,Fit well on my head.,190
760,5) No clicking sound from the buttons as reported by other users.,190
761,For $30 you cannot complain though.,190
762,"This have good sound and okay bass,  they do need more treble but overall good product for the price.",190
763,"Sound is balanced, not too much of anything (so the bass wasn't that good for electronic music and such, but it was there)but a little muffled.",190
764,"2014 CHristo as my Grandma purchased these head phones for me, they were great till late November of this year.",190
765,I was a bit apprehensive before because I had never heard of the brand Kinivo.,190
766,These are great headphones.,190
767,I have been constantly using it for over 10 months now and it still charges as new and has the same sound quality ... !,190
768,they make my head look rounder because they are a bit wide but the sound quality is great!,190
769,"Even without moving them a little bit, they are not like similar styles of headphones, that hurt my ears or pinched my head ..",190
770,Couldn't ask for anything better!,190
771,"When I told him what I paid, and what these normally cost on the electronics aisle at Walgreens (maybe $20), he asked for a pair of his own.",190
772,I have been having multiple issues with the microphone input of the NEXUS 4 phone.,190
773,The quality when using it for phone calls is very poor.,190
774,"For the price, the sounds is awesome and really makes you feel you are right in either the concert or movie theater!",190
775,I saved a ton of money and the headphones audio is superb!,191
776,They feel as equally comfortable around your neck as in your head.,191
777,"These are good, inexpensive general purpose headphones.",191
778,"These work really well (not perfect) with my iPhone 5, MapMyFitness, and my Fitletic Race Belt.",191
779,The flap is useless and always sticking out making the BTH240 unappealing.,191
780,I really like these!,191
781,"They're great for that, and so much more.",191
782,This headset was exactly what I needed!,191
783,Sent them back thinking that they were a dud and ordered a replacement.,191
784,Only and minor complaint is that the plastic band stretches .,191
785,Niceb Bluetooth headphones.,191
786,"Arrived in good time, tried it with iPhone voice calls and with my music playlist.",191
787,"I can actually hear the bass of my music thrumming now and have found myself getting startled occasionally, even, as they pick up softer sounds in the background of my music that I had not previously heard.",191
788,I have been using these headphones for months and they are still in good working order.,191
789,It is very nice to be able to move around my work space without a cord tethering me to the computer.,191
790,In case your wondering in those three years the sound is the same (This time I bough the Black Colored Version) so there is no downgrade in the quality that at times happens.,191
791,These are just the ticket.,191
792,So if it has perfect sound...I can't judge.,191
793,I have tried them out and can't find a thing wrong with them.,191
794,Bought this a month and it was working well until today .,191
795,These Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones are good.,191
796,"I made sure they were well taken care of, but maybe I used them too much.",191
797,Happy with the price point and glad I purchased them.,191
798,"I love that it adjusts, and it's easy to figure out which side is right vs. left (the red color goes on the right, by the way).",191
799,"They work fine, but the sound quality is typical of $20 headphones.",191
800,What you get are well constructed headphones with solid performance and very good Sony quality.,192
801,"But for the price, I think that these are way more than worth it if you need a cheap pair of headphones that will last you longer than twinkies in the post nuclear world.",192
802,The only gripe would be the band is stiff and really really wide.,192
803,"they are good, minimize external sound, very comfortable and easy on the ears.",192
804,"I've been using it for a good 4 month to this date by now, and so far I had absolutely no trouble nor any malfunctions.",192
805,I will keep an eye but so far so good!,192
806,"Fit well on any audio jack ipod, tablet, desktop, ds, psp, etc.!",192
807,They are not noise canceling and they are bulky.,192
808,I purchased these a year ago along with a portable DVD player for our car.,192
809,"AFTER MY FIRST TRY I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM, THE SOUND IS LOUD AND DETAILED, THE BASS IS JUST RIGHT, NOT TOO MUCH TO THE POINT IT DISTORTS THE QUALITY OF SONGS.",192
810,The distance for these is good as well - I have yet to go past their reach.,192
811,I have been having multiple issues with the microphone input of the NEXUS 4 phone.,192
812,Not distracting - cannot be heard by others nearby while I am wearing these.,192
813,"Like I said, I've only used it once, but the one time it was awesome.",192
814,I bought one of these 2 years ago.,192
815,But there are other affordable options out there that perform a little better.,192
816,Those could break easily.,192
817,I would NOT recommend these for purchase from anywhere.,192
818,I received the item within two days of placing the order so I was extremely happy about that.,192
819,My daughter uses these with her studio equipment.,192
820,There's now a rubber cover on the micro USB jack; added protection from the elements and looks better.,192
821,"On the other hand, they sound great and are at a fantastic price point.",192
822,And plenty of reviewers here swear by their comfort and ability to stay on while exercising.,192
823,The previous set I owned (different brand) lasted for 5 months before they crapped out.,192
824,Price: Amazing price!,192
825,"They feel light weight and easily breakable so we've been treating these delicately, but they work great and totally tune out background noise.",193
826,These are terribly uncomfortable.,193
827,They also lay flay which is nice for travel.,193
828,These are also pretty uncomfortable on your ears and becomes painful when worn for a long period of time.,193
829,Even though I dropped it more times than I can count.,193
830,"Nope, they're pretty comfortable, and I've rarely found headphone I didn't hate, I have a rather large head and imagine they'd be super comfortable on most people.",193
831,"This is an un-necessary glitch for  what I previously considered the best portable blue-tooth headphones, including the unilateral  in-ear-piece models, I have ever owned.",193
832,"Secondly, the ear cups don't swivel nearly as much as the older ones did, which makes it difficult to place them on your head.",193
833,Can't believe they were as inexpensive as they were.,193
834,"But overall, it isn't too bad for the price.",193
835,I ended up immediately purchasing Bose AE2i's and am extremely happy with them.,193
836,Lastly I just want to say that these come with a nice sturdy cord.,193
837,"This set can be stored away flattened, you simply turn the phones in sideways.",193
838,I wish that the fit was adjustable.,193
839,The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that I was hoping it would fit over my ears and not sit on them.,193
840,They come with a long cord which is convenient for the purpose of their use.,193
841,"In sum, it's a great deal.",193
842,"Probably needless to say, the Bose OE2 lightweight headphones, also top rated by Consumer Reports, sound the best.",193
843,They just last song long.,193
844,Will update this review to let you know what I think.,193
845,Don't get me wrong I love this product and I went safe and purchased the product from amazon not a seller.,193
846,"They came in the mail within two days of my order, which made me very pleased.",193
847,UPATE: Their customer service notified me after reading this review and sent me a new paid to replace the pair with the power issue.,193
848,I'm REALLY suprised by all the 1 and 2 star reviews.,193
849,"It should be noted that they can be had from Best Buy for $20 with free shipping, rather than the $40 amazon is at right now.",193
850,"I was able to put it back in and use it still, but it pops out still every now and again.",194
851,I honestly would have returned it but was too lazy.,194
852,I bought two for my kids.,194
853,But then again what can you expect for $30 bucks.,194
854,I'm still contemplating reordering because I do like them.,194
855,Very good volume.,194

862,Just got back from a 2100 mile road trip and these held up to abuses of 3 young boys tossing them around the car for 2 weeks!,194
863,"Every time I turned on these headphones, it typically would take a couple seconds longer to sync up with my phone than other Bluetooth headphones I've used in the past.",194
864,Sony has had a great reputation for years but it is in decline.,194
865,The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the band is a little wide and I have a hard time to fit them well to my head.,194
866,Love these Bluetooth Stereo Headphones.,194
867,"Before I even downloaded all my songs to the new MP3 I purchased from Amazon at the same time as these groovy headphones, one of the earpieces fell into a vodker and soda...soaked to schmitt.",194
868,$15 for over the ear headphones is a good price.,194
869,"On the other hand, they sound great and are at a fantastic price point.",194
870,"Having said all that, I blame myself, not the headphones.",194
871,This headset sits slightly awkward during running but stays on for a while.,194

875,Everything in electronics is black it seems.,195
876,I can't use earbuds and corded phones are such a nuisance.,195
877,"Don't expect to get the best pair of headphones ever, but I've found that they're probably worth at least 30 or 35 dollars.",195

880,Best headphone I've ever used.,195
881,"Appear a bit cheaply made, I think the all-black selection may look better than this red/black color, but it isn't horrible - not garish.",195
882,The bad: Maybe I have bigger ears but sometimes they take some fiddling to get comfortable on my head.,195
883,It is very annoying to get rapped in the cord when you are trying to run so I bought these.,195
884,"And thats not even the loudest the headphones can go, I have not tried these at full volume, and I don't plan on it, I'd rather not blow the speakers.",195
885,Sound is okay/cool and I love that the right side has a read mark so u can easily know what side to put where.,195

887,Well made and very very durable so far after about 2 months of daily use by a 3 and 8 year old.,195
888,Great value and performance.,195
889,I've also put it in many bags when traveling where I'm sure the cords were angled in a way that should have caused fraying but the cords are fine.,195
890,These things have fabulous sound and range.,195
891,It has very good bluetooth connectivity.,195
892,Great distance and battery life.,195

900,Be mindful of this if you have a bigger head.,196

911,The play time has been good and about 8 hours on one charge.,196
912,"I'd rather pay more for better quality, but even the more expensive ones from Sony that are similar to this, have the same problems.",196
913,These work great.,196
914,You just can't complain at this price.,196
915,"Other than that, regardless of how I have it on, it fits well enough that I can't complain.",196
916,"The portion that wraps around your ear can get a little sore and annoying after a while, but just a little adjusting and it will go away.",196
917,They continue to look nice after months of use and are easy to clean.,196
918,There are no better headphones on Earth for this price.,196
919,I work in a lab and have to move around a lot while working so getting rid of cables was my highest priority followed closely by battery life.,196
920,I've had other headphones like these in the past but I didn't expect anything more for cheap headphones.,196
921,Just like other people saying the cord should be at least 6 inch longer.,196
922,I feel like a little more width around back might help give a better angle that wouldn't pinch my ears.,196
923,I bought this color and the white one for my kids that last longer than other brands.,196
924,I am sure this is a good headset but not for what I needed it for.,196

933,The control buttons work smoothly and my iPhone 6 connected immediately and the calls are easy to answer and crystal clear.,197
934,I sleep with them and they don't get all tangled or bent.,197
935,I was very impressed.,197
936,I like this much better.,197

1052,I find that I don't even realize that I am wearing them.,202
1053,The only reason I didn't give it four stars was the occasional cracking noise that I would hear when moving to a distant area from the Bluetooth device but that seems common in any Bluetooth device.,202
1054,"For the price, these are unbeatable.",202
1055,"unfortunately, they are a little too flimsy for my taste and it  took me a while to use them.",202

1078,Just bought a second pair so my wife can listen to her audio books!,203

1086,I will buy more from Kinivo products in the future.,203
1087,This means there's some degree of noise insulation.,203

1155,These were a great fit.,206
1156,"I purchased this set of headphones, in addition to the Koss UR-20, for use with my portable mp3 player.",206
1157,I cannot believe that headphones that are 11$ could be this good.,206

1159,Very happy with this purchase.,206
1160,"However, my son loves them.",206
1161,These broke after about 2 months of use.,206

1166,"They are comfortable, and you can't beat the price.",206

1175,These headphones are great for my daily walks...they also keep my ears warm in the winter...I live in frigid MN!,207
1176,"You'll be fine listening to rap and hip-hop, but stuff like dubstep, with alot of bass, would sound bad.",207

1182,Great sound for the price.,207
1183,I would highly recommend this product.,207
1184,Over the ear without encasing my whole head and heating me up.,207
1185,If you read these reviews you would think otherwise.,207

1187,"Great sound, quality, and bass for the price.",207
1188,Only wish they worked properly and that they felt comfy on my ears.,207

1199,Unit arrived early in perfect packing shipment.,207
1200,I am very disappointed.,208
1201,I'd wonder if someone with normal or large ears might have some trouble with the size of the ear pieces.,208
1202,Not the best sound quality but considering the price they are as good as most headphones in the $30-$70 range.,208
1203,"After touching and using the product Kinivo, Arctic, Soundbot ranging from $20 - $36 are going to be about the same quality in sound.",208
1204,I do find these more comfortable for all day wear than every other pair of headphones that I've owned.,208
1205,"If value and quantity are important considerations, you won't go wrong here.",208
1206,Connected easily to my iPhone and iPad and they block out most of the outside noise.,208
1207,Light an fit his little ears and head with no problem.,208
1208,The fit is comfortable as well and do not feel like they are putting your skull in a vise yet there is no danger of them falling off.,208

1213,I've used this for about two weeks.,208
1214,Small children I have.,208

1220,"I was okay with all these, since I know they are a new company and will get to the point that they are making good products.",208
1221,Definitely a bargain.,208
1222,"Boosts the bass volume compared to my macbook, but not too heavy that it's bothersome in my ears.",208
1223,These are also pretty uncomfortable on your ears and becomes painful when worn for a long period of time.,208
1224,I really wanted to get away from the wired ear buds I was using in the office as I would rip them out anytime I turned around.,208
1225,"These headphones do go quite loud, but when you crank them up, they are very bass heavy.",209
1226,"- I don't care how cheap it is, if your product is not really noise canceling, do not advertise it as such.",209
1227,I do wear glasses but have had no problem with other headphones.,209
1228,"So, I figured since I was happy with Sony, that would be the place to look.",209
1229,"After prolonged use and removing, my ears don't feel like I just came out of a compression chamber, and while my ears may feel warm, they aren't sweaty.",209
1230,"They gave me a bit of a headache when I first starting using them, but it was so worth it.",209
1231,He is constantly taking phone calls as well.,209
1232,He's loves them.,209
1233,I use the pair they have at my office and after twenty minutes my ears hurt.,209

 fantastic.",209

1239,"I've tried downloading various drivers per the advice of Kinivo's tech support (who were NOT very helpful, rushed through our conversation) and nothing works.",209
1240,Easy to pair with devices also.,209
1241,Everything in electronics is black it seems.,209
1242,I also wear glasses.,209
1243,"The ear piece is a bit big, but you get an amazing sound from them almost like stereo head srt.",209
1244,I've had a pair of these and used them every single day for the past 4 years at work.,209
1245,"Plug doesn't fit my macbook pro; too loose, keeps falling out.",209
1246,the 'ear pads' are really comfortable even when wearing them for a few hours.,209
1247,My happiness scale goes all the way up when I listen to music through these.,209
1248,I would always wear my cord under my shirt to minimize the snagging which works alright until I start sweating.,209
1249,I thought they were going to be one of those crappy headphones that broke after you took it out of the box,209
1250,"My previous headset, an LG HBS-730 had significant issues in this area, and I'm very happy to say the difference between the two headsets is night and day.",210
1251,"I have not done a phone call with this, so I cannot attest to how well you'd sound on the other end and vice versa.",210
1252,"I purchased these headphones for my son in hopes that I would no longer be subjected to hours and hours of minecraft coming from my sons tablet....well, they worked for about 2 weeks before no sound came from the right speaker anymore.",210
1253,My old ones had a longer cord but for the price they are still very good.,210
1254,"This model is replacing the better quality, better sounding MDR-V150 model.",210
1255,I took a chance and it paid off.,210
1256,While these were cheap they also felt like it.,210
1257,"I haven't had mine for very long and they seem to be made of cheap plastic, but Sony products tend to last a long time, so I'm not sure about the life span of these.",210
1258,"Overall, if the point is to listen to music, fine.",210
1259,Long term durability is questionable at best.,210
1260,Scares me real bad and is annoying.,210
1261,I have used them all week at the gym and they are the best!,210
1262,"Disappointed, but somewhat satisfied.",210
1263,"But if you want to spend some where under $30, might want to give these a try.",210
1264,This is my fourth set of these headphones.,210
1265,"I felt they were very comfortable as well, lightweight etc.",210
1266,I'm glad that I did.,210
1267,For the money you can't go wrong.,210
1268,Wouldn't recommend to anyone hoping for quality with a low price tag.,210
1269,Don't waste your money on such a cheap piece of crap.,210
1270,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,210
1271,I purchased several different brands of headphones for my 5 year old to use at computer class at school but they kept breaking.,210
1272,The quality when using it for phone calls is very poor.,210
1273,The volume and skip track buttons give off a loud click when depressed; that click is amplified right next to the ear.,210
1274,This is my second pair - after owning the 220s for a year or more I got the 240s for my wife for exercising and she likes them a lot.,210
1275,"Overall, I'm happy with them, particularly at the $15.99 price point.",211
1276,Would most definitely buy another pair of these!,211
1277,"I didn't expect that much from them, but when my son (who is 8) started to rave about how awesome they are I had to try them out.",211
1278,I have to sit directly in front of the stereo on the floor to use them.,211
1279,I bought a pair of beats solos and am writing this review with the Sonys on my head.,211
1280,"They are comfortable, and drown out sound pretty well.",211
1281,We are talking here about a $25 Headphone.,211
1282,"I bought this as a recommendation from Matt Ogus, professional bodybuilder.",211
1283,"-They stay on perfectly well while I exercise (workouts generally include lots of movement, and LOTS of sweat).",211
1284,I prefer these over the Jay bird 2s that cost $170.,211
1285,I bought this back in 2014 for school and just to relax with.,211
1286,Much better than I expected.,211
1287,"Easy to wear (not uncomfortable), stay on my ears when i need them to, not much else to say.",211
1288,BUUUUUTTT it does not adjust (guess everyones head is the same size) and the fitting on the ear is small.,211
1289,Super comfy because I don't have to shove a plug into my ear.,211
1290,"When I ordered this product I thought it was just going to be another pair of headphones, boy was I wrong.",211
1291,I use them with my smartphone and if I'm watching television or listening to music all I have to do is push a button on the side to answer a call.,211
1292,"Overall, I highly recommend them for the average listener, but not for the audiophile snob types.",211
1293,No issues so far.,211
1294,For a great price!,211
1295,These are perfect for what I need.,211
1296,The cord is still 8ft but the head set is comparable in size to the Sony's.,211
1297,These are keepers.,211
1298,I will be returning them.,211
1299,"Reveals unknown facts of the sex, drugs, and rock and roll, also includes a very personal account of Ann's struggle with her weight.",211

1301,"Paired quickly and stays connected consistently, with good range.",212
1302,"These did the trick, and for less than 20 dollars.",212
1303,I've used this for about two weeks.,212
1304,As far as I can tell awesome product.,212
1305,Down with Bluetooth.,212
1306,Connection to my laptop was seamless.,212
1307,These headphones are actually a lot better than I was expecting.,212
1308,For the money...they work well.,212
1309,"The sound is crisp and clear, and they are pretty loud.",212
1310,"They are very light weight, they fold for easy carrying in the bag that was provided and the sound is excellent.",212
1311,"Otherwise, it's a solid pair for the price!",212
1312,SONY consistently delivers good quality.,212
1313,Sony's website lists them as not circumaural[0].,212
1314,"Also, these are not overly huge like other over ear headphones and since they cuff around your ears toward the back of your lower neck area, it doesn't get in the way of weight training.",212
1315,I've been using them for more then a month and so far so good!,212
1316,"I don't know how they even justified the largest setting, as no one must have a head that large
-These are NOT circumaural.",212
1317,sound quality is good and for the price you cant get any better.,212
1318,Love the color and the sound is great!!!!,212
1319,(Which is more than I can say for may other brands.),212
1320,"I've had these headphones for less than six months and now the left side has blown out, for $25 I kind of expected more.",212
1321,I wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid.,212
1322,"Very sturdy, stays on your head.",212
1323,I bought these because I'm a hooper and I like to practice in the wee hours when everyone else is asleep.,212
1324,Only alternative was to send them back.,212
1325,There is about a half inch of space between the back portion of the headphones that are suppose to rest on the back of your head.,213
1326,The are good for what I need them to do,213
1327,"Cons:
Don't get too loud
Bass is nothing compared to my cheaper, in-ear buds.",213
1328,"I've generally been happy with the Sony products I've used, but often found them a bit pricier than similar options.",213
1329,"However, if you want to use these headphones to eavesdrop on people, it's a five-star product.",213
1330,I finally decided to look on Amazon and these looked highly recommended and for $25 I didn't think I was taking much of a risk.,213
1331,I use these primarily for listening to training videos or low volume music when reading.,213
1332,I won't detract a star for this design because the knivo is an excellent product.,213
1333,I plan on taking better care of these.,213
1334,I have to buy a second one becuase i broke the wire to the left speaker,213
1335,"They're not great for running with though, as they shift small amounts as you run making noise as the padding around the ears shifts.",213
1336,"The sound is slightly better than low-end to mid-range in ears or ear-buds, but surprisingly not by much.",213
1337,Well made and very very durable so far after about 2 months of daily use by a 3 and 8 year old.,213
1338,I love sony headphones I have the white pair and I have the black pair now.,213
1339,Connection gets disturbed occationally but nothing to really complain about.,213
1340,This is still applicable even during calls.,213
1341,Probably not ideal for kids but it still works.,213
1342,Don't fall off durning workout or jog.,213
1343,"I have 4 pair just lying around the house, so that when someone wants to use them, they can.",213
1344,Unfortunately they will stop holding a charge after a month or so of everyday use.,213
1345,I would definitely buy them again!,213
1346,"There is no tone definition, very muddy sounding.",213
1347,The Sony MDRZX100/BLK Headphones work and sound great.,213
1348,"Plus, I'm not super picky about anything as long as I can hear my music clearly and enjoy it.",213
1349,I have has the for 5 whole days now.,213
1350,Gift for my wife as she had been using some pretty crude earphones to listen to music from her laptop.,214
1351,They can get pretty loud.,214
1352,They are great for working out as well; just make sure you wipe them clean when you towel off since they are not waterproof.,214
1353,I will return this product.,214
1354,I am using it with my nano touch.,214
1355,They work great and are durable (my son uses them for the computer lab at school).,214
1356,"Although they are mainly plastic, they are quite durable as I've used them virtually everyday since I purchased them in January of this year.",214
1357,I probably got a lemon.,214
1358,"I bought this as a recommendation from Matt Ogus, professional bodybuilder.",214
1359,"#1 TV audio for me, #2 keep the wife tuned out.",214
1360,This is NOT Amazon's fault.,214
1361,That didn't help.,214
1362,These are great headphones.,214
1363,"Low cost, low quality.",214
1364,**the instruction book that comes with the headset specifies the A2DP setting and once i figured out how to set that properly i've had no issues.,214
1365,ALSO it came in black-not white.,214
1366,I love these headphones.,214
1367,I wear X-Large hats so have a large head but these headphones are comfortable for a few hours wear.,214
1368,"I wanted to see how low impedance headphones would work with this amplifier, whether I would hear any hiss or hum with such low impedance headphones, and the amplifier passed with flying colors.",214
1369,I got what I payed for.,214
1370,"This is less than that, do not buy these.",214
1371,I let people listen and now 3 other people have bought them.,214
1372,"They could be uncomfortable if you have glasses, as the frame could get pressed against your ear.",214
1373,"Easy to use, light (in spite of their size), these headphones are really perfect.",214

looks like premium product with cheap price
worth every penny",215
1380,I've had this for about 3 weeks now and I freaking love it!,215
1381,There have been other comments about sound quality not the greatest because of being Bluetooth but I think they sound fine.,215
1382,I ended up immediately purchasing Bose AE2i's and am extremely happy with them.,215
1383,I had discovered with the 220s that I had to have my phone in my right front pocket for a steady connection because the receiver for the headphones is in the right side.,215
1384,I assume the headset's connecting wire  is supposed to ride along the back side of the neck or head.,215
1385,The jack is finicky and doesn't always connect to my computer right away.,215
1386,I would highly recommend this product.,215
1387,Absolutely horrible.,215
1388,"They are great for around the house listening, and as my first bluetooth headphones, they have greatly increased the amount of music and podcasts I listen to arond the house, mostly from my tablet.",215
1389,"I really like the red color in the right side, that makes it look nice.",215

1403,I do not recommend for adults.,216
1404,They were really comfortable but if I wore them for more than a few hours they started to bug my ears.,216
1405,I purchased several different brands of headphones for my 5 year old to use at computer class at school but they kept breaking.,216
1406,"They're small and would be a great size for a child, the sound quality is ok, it sounds a bit low and the bass isn't much, it doesn't sound like the 20$ sony headphones, this pair would be a step down from that.",216

1429,I have worn these on an airplane and could hardly hear the jets.,217
1430,Buy two just in case.,217
1431,What I don't like is the sense that it lacks a little oomph.,217
1432,"If you're like me and listen to music or movies occasionally, these are perfect.",217
1433,"Anyway, these work really well and seem like they would last a long time--if you keep them out of your mouth.",217
1434,"If you're looking for noise cancelling or higher sound quality, I would not recommend these.",217

1443,These seem like a great buy and well made.,217
1444,I don't know why this product has so many good reviews.,217
1445,"The connector is 90 degrees, so if you're looking for a straight connector, this won't do.",217

1465,They work pretty good.,218

1499,"Maybe these aren't perfectly audiophile but it would be hard to touch this quality without spending a whole, whole lot more.",219
1500,"It's not the most comfortable experience if you wear glasses, and it makes leaning your head back uncomfortable.",220
1501,All of the New Music I just down loaded sounded greater than I ever expected.,220
1502,What I really love about them is that I can control my iPhone or Apple watch music functions with the buttons on the side of the ear cover.,220

1507,These work just as well.,220
1508,EDIT: cheap fix for more comfortable headphones is to tuck 1~2 stretched cotton balls into the pads.,220
1509,I run treadmills and rid trains with this and can't care about anyone else's opinion about the brand because they don't know what perfection I'm listening to.,220

1680,My first set got me through most of a three-year stint at college before my continued abuse of the wires finally shorted out one ear.,227

1692,"Basically, I take VOIP calls/meetings now and I don't have to use my desk phone/home phone / cell phone.",227
1693,I would characterize my head size as average for an adult male.,227
1694,They are awesome!,227
1695,Can't believe these were so highly rated.,227
1696,I like the overall rating of this headphone.,227
1697,I even got a hug 3 days ago from the 9 year old for buying them.,227
1698,Easy to configure and use.,227
1699,Not the best sound quality but considering the price they are as good as most headphones in the $30-$70 range.,227
1700,"They are cheap, but there are many -- MANY other cheap headphones that are much better than these.",228
1701,They seem way more robust than the V150s too.,228
1702,I have used these twice in major rain storms and haven't missed a beat!!,228
1703,I only read the negative reviews so I could find out the quirks that most users found with them.,228
1704,Finally got the time to use my headphones yesterday.,228
1705,Might as well get the beats by dr dre they are much better the sound stinks!!!,228
1706,I quickly discovered the wire was loose at the end connecting to plug.,228
1707,Great price for a pretty ok sound.,228
1708,For this price you can't ask for anything better.,228
1709,They are well built and have held up to anything I have put them through.,228
1710,Sound escapes it - terrible for discreet listening/listening to something loud in quiet places.,228
1711,"If you're looking for noise cancelling or higher sound quality, I would not recommend these.",228
1712,I cannot believe that headphones that are 11$ could be this good.,228
1713,I got these headphones in an odd way.,228
1714,"In case they do die, I will buy these again.",228
1715,"I could probably talk anyone out of the SoundBot and Sonys, but the last two are neck and neck (no pun intended).",228
1716,"These sound very good, not awesome.",228
1717,These aren't really either.,228
1718,They don't hug my head too tightly (where I might get a headache).,228
1719,They looked comfortable and were made by Sony which is a tried and true brand that I completely trust.,228
1720,I do recommend these headphones for general use.,228
1721,I will be echoing the sentiments of many.,228
1722,Great for the money!,228
1723,Also volume is good.,228
1724,These headphones are budget friendly.,228
1725,I'm not sure if its the brand or where I got it from but BUYER BEWARE!,229
1726,better then what i expected i recommend this item they feel good look nice and they do not look cheap i give this item 5 stars got to me on time and really good,229
1727,I think these things will cause wear over time and cause these sort of issues.,229
1728,"They do get a little uncomfortable after extended wearing, but it's not a deal breaker.",229
1729,- The good thing with these is these will work with both cell phones and PC's.,229
1730,My first set got me through most of a three-year stint at college before my continued abuse of the wires finally shorted out one ear.,229
1731,"Both models respond well to my phone's EQ app, letting me boost the deep bass and highest treble.",229
1732,Battery last for me about 9 hours on full charge while at work listening to music for that entire time.,229
1733,For the price these are fantastic!,229
1734,these are great and a great price.,229
1735,I bought these after years of wanting a pair of Bluetooth headphones and I am glad I did.,229
1736,"However, after bumping my first song on it, I immediately felt 100% satisfied with my purchase.",229
1737,"They work fine, but the sound quality is typical of $20 headphones.",229
1738,"Update 2/11/15 ...

Just bought another set of these.",229
1739,"I don't use it for phone calls much; it's not ideal for calls, but it works.",229
1740,I checked out the Amazon reviews and also noticed that thewirecutter.com gave them a very good review.,229
1741,I'm also a musician (bass) and  I think the music quality is very good.,229
1742,"I think either the technology is still evolving or better technology is still costly or else, speakers at this cost are meant to be this way.",229
1743,"The sound is surprisingly good, the padding is comfortable, and they don't cost much.",229
1744,Enter Kinivo BTH (behind the head I assume?).,229
1745,"I get a crazy long range, maybe about 100-150 feet from one end of the plant to the trailer bay.",229
1746,I've had problems with it pairing at all with other bluetooth speakers.,229
1747,"The fit is comfortable, the volume doesnt get as loud as you would like but for the price it was a good investment for bluetooth since I cant stand wired headphones.",229
1748,"At this price point/quality, these headphones are unmatched.",229
1749,"Comfortable, great for bike riding, fits with helmet.",229
1750,Can't wait to go full force in the gym with these.,230
1751,contacted kinivo's customer service and the rep emailed me a return label.,230
1752,I bought this pair to replace my Sony MDR-V150 headphones which have deteriorating ear pads.,230
1753,"Lightweight, feels comfortable around ears, and provides above-average sound for the price.",230
1754,I usually only do it after shirts vs skins basketball games when I do an impromptu press conference or I Kanye Weat my pastor of the church to talk about Beyonce's gospel album.,230
1755,In fact I can go outside and clean the ice and snow off my vehicle and still get excellent sound.,230
1756,These aren't really either.,230
1757,They are not very comfortable.,230
1758,"I'd recommend KOSS Titanium cheapo's instead.. for the same basic price range they are lighter, sound much better and are more comfortable, plus have volume slider... they just don't have the full enclosure for blocking other sounds as much.",230
1759,"Sound is pretty good, but do not buy if you intend to use for workouts.",230
1760,I was surprised on how good the bass was (for twenty something bucks).,230
1761,"I don't expect bose quality on a $30 pair of headphones, but they are pretty darn good!",230
1762,This is good for slim and medium size people only.,230
1763,We only use these on long trips and they've only been used about 3-4 times.,230
1764,"Honestly, I had never heard of Kinivo, but after trying them I found them to be comfortable AND capable of withstanding some sweat.",230
1765,"I told him i had got these Sony headphones your tablet, when plugged the headphones into his tablet  only 1 speaker would sound  (the left side only).",230
1766,These are hands down the best headphones for this price out there.,230
1767,I'm not sure exactly how far it is ... maybe 60-75 feet or so ... far enough to be able to get a drink or go grab some equipment without having to move my phone.,230
1768,"Sound is pretty good, but do not buy if you intend to use for workouts.",230
1769,"A few days later, they responded letting me know that they were sending a whole new set of headphones and that they should be arriving quickly.",230
1770,Bought for myself.,230
1771,I wear glasses and its just a quick adjustment when putting them on to compensate for over the ear wearing.,230
1772,"Battery is a small 3.7v 400mAh rectangle battery, almost the same as the ones used in the small quadcopter drones.",230
1773,I bought the Photive BTH3 instead and wish I hadn't wasted my time these headphones.,230
1774,They just recently died they no longer turn on.,230
1775,I don't know why but I love them!,231
1776,"I have bought many pairs of ear buds, all painful.",231
1777,"Cords are honestly the way to go, these cheap pos will only frustrate you.",231
1778,great headphones in my opinion better than beats but leak alot of sound and they fit well i have an afro and they are big enough to go over that so they please me and they handle bass well,231
1779,"The price is so good, that I had trouble justifying paying the same amount for a protective case for them, so they won't get banged up in my backpack.",231
1780,The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the band is a little wide and I have a hard time to fit them well to my head.,231
1781,"The audio quality is superb, but that does not amount to much if you can't stand to wear them.",231
1782,"Sound quality is clear if you don't need any true base, but overall they feel very cheap for Sony Headphones.",231
1783,"These sound great, and as such make for an incredible value.",231
1784,"For the price you're paying, you're probably not going to get much better quality than this, that said, there are a few issues, namely, no volume control on the headset itself, sometimes sound is a little weird til you tinker with the cord.",231
1785,They fold up nicely.,231
1786,Other than that they fit good around my ears and drown out other sounds'.,231
1787,These lasted me a good year and half before they gave out on me :( They were amazing for the price and will be sorely missed.,231
1788,"If he wouldn't have kept them I would have given them a 2, but he thinks they're just fine and hasn't experienced any issues with them.",231
1789,"Gave these as a gift to a friend and received positive feedback as the headphones did not give her a headache as others do (did not squeeze her head as tightly, and fit perfectly).",231
1790,Very inconvenient.,231
1791,They sound great and I love the phone feature.,231
1792,I sent them back.,231
1793,I was surprised on how good the bass was (for twenty something bucks).,231
1794,Tried these in a store that is why I bought them.,231
1795,I think it actually lasts longer too.,231
1796,"Headband pads can be bought, but the hot water pipe insulation was all I had available at the time.",231
1797,I would not recommend this to a person who plans to wear headphones for more than 45mins per use.,231
1798,Easily heard by people around you.,231
1799,The sound quality is very good and has good strong bass.,231

1801,The sound on these headphones is great.,232
1802,I thank the many other users for the great reviews that brought me to this purchase.,232
1803,"Not that I was using them... oh, which brings up another good point!",232
1804,"I've read that some sound quality gets lost, but I never noticed, since I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks.",232
1805,The only difference I see is that the BTH240 uses the same size USB cord all of the cell phones in the house seem to use.,232
1806,I sleep with them and they don't get all tangled or bent.,232
1807,You will love not having to deal with cords.,232
1808,"I was really blown away when I first listened to these, because they greatly exceeded my expectations.",232
1809,Perhaps someone reading this review will have an idea.,232
1810,"I've owned a lot of wired headphones, some of which were hi end.",232
1811,They were tested out with 2 iPhone 5s and the new iPad w/retina display & a Dell laptop.,232
1812,"It seems like they have definitely worked the bugs out of these, at least for my use.",232
1813,Sony headphones are pretty good with great sound and fix very well on my head and ears.,232
1814,They're the best ones I've ever owned.,232

1816,Would recommend them to anyone.,232

1820,The spring pressure is all right and does not become annoying after an hour of use.,232
1821,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,232
1822,If one side just had a nub or braille I'd have a much easier time making sure they were on the right way (and this would also make them friendly for the blind).,232
1823,"Gave to my 12 year old grandson and he was so very excited, spent the rest of Christmas vacation with them on his head listening to music almost all the time.",232
1824,"Overall, I highly recommend them for the average listener, but not for the audiophile snob types.",232
1825,"I use them at work, at the gym.",233
1826,Would recommend them to anyone.,233
1827,It was delivered one day ahead of the scheduled date.,233
1828,"However, if you can spend a little bit more, I would suggest spending 100-200$ for a much punchier and clearer sound.",233
1829,"I wasn't expecting great sound quality for the price, but I did expect them to work.",233
1830,Money well spent!,233
1831,The first problem I noticed is the sound quality.,233
1832,"When I saw the picture, I expected a bigger pair of headphones.",233
1833,I just got these in the mail.,233
1834,Cannot get the headphones to pair with any bluetooth items.,233
1835,This headset is equal to a much higher priced set.,233
1836,Decent build...they are plastic and I'll have to be gentle with them.,233
1837,The music sounds very clear and the sound quality is great.,233
1838,"I have never owned a ""behind the neck"" set of headphones.",233
1839,Guess these might not be all that cool I guess I really don't know but if you are a pork and beaner and looking for about the best $30 dollar item in the whole world this may very well be it.,233
1840,"The sound quality is not breathtaking my any means, but I believe a very good value for the price.",233
1841,The spring pressure is all right and does not become annoying after an hour of use.,233
1842,So that means they still need to improve the microphones on the stereo headsets.,233
1843,The price makes this product even better.,233
1844,So far I really like them.,233
1845,podcasts and such.,233
1846,"Typically less than a second, but occasionally stretches longer for short periods.",233
1847,I have a wonderful 12 yr old who breaks everything that he touches.,233
1848,But it fits on the ears in such a way that it hurts the ears after listening for a while; say 30min.,233
1849,I discovered that the sound quality was noticeably poor if bearable.,233
1850,"I'm not sure whether if the sound had to do with the apple products, but both the Sony headphones, and my old generic $10.00  store bought headphones produced the same sound.",234
1851,Color: Black I have purchased 3 of these and one has lasted for several years.,234
1852,"Nice headphones for the money, but the mic and noise canceling is very poor.",234
1853,You should be fine if you're only going to do light use.,234
1854,Only finally found ONE image.,234
1855,Worth the money.,234
1856,This allows me to hear my music clearly and spend less time adjusting the earbuds falling out of my ears.,234
1857,"Both models respond well to my phone's EQ app, letting me boost the deep bass and highest treble.",234
1858,I love the headphones.,234
1859,"While this a negative, I don't want to wear any headphones much longer than that anyway because it's just not good for your ears.",234
1860,Also better construction than I dreamed for the price.,234
1861,I've had these headphones for about 7 months and I love them.,234
1862,Replaced another pair which did not hold a charge for more than two hours.,234
1863,"Looks great, sound quality is good, somewhat above average, but ear coverage is minimal, could easily (inexpensively) be and so should be larger, and I found the cord to be too short.",234
1864,I bought these to play music for our baby while she's in the womb.,234
1865,If you read these reviews you would think otherwise.,234
1866,This is good for slim and medium size people only.,234
1867,"There is no adjustment for size, like some high-end (and high dollar) phones.",234
1868,I was using wired headphones that didn't have a mic so I feel safer being out in the pre-dawn knowing I can call out at the press of a button on my headset.,234
1869,"They are very nice , lightweight, which is what I wanted.",234
1870,"I'd rather pay more for better quality, but even the more expensive ones from Sony that are similar to this, have the same problems.",234
1871,They are great for running or other exercise.,234
1872,They are not very comfortable.,234
1873,I'm not interested in making phone calls with those headphones.,234
1874,The Sony MDRZX100/BLK Headphones work and sound great.,234
1875,"In case they do die, I will buy these again.",235
1876,Connected easily to my iPhone and iPad and they block out most of the outside noise.,235
1877,"They are comfortable, and you can't beat the price.",235
1878,"They are small, really small.",235
1879,"Cons:
1. when walking the outside noise can be loader than the headset.",235
1880,"If value and quantity are important considerations, you won't go wrong here.",235
1881,"But if you want to spend some where under $30, might want to give these a try.",235
1882,The battery life is amazing after all this time I still get a full 8 hours of talk time.,235
1883,"""It appears that you ordered a pair of Sony headphones for $15.86.",235
1884,They aren't amazing by any means and at times seems a little fuzzy.,235
1885,I bought this headset to avoid all the wire tangling troubles with my wired earphones.,235
1886,I love these headphones!,235
1887,This headphone isolates just enough sound for me to enjoy the music while letting some sound in which is essential for safety.,235
1888,My two boys ( teenagers) use them for school and for their music and there has been no complaint on the sound.,235
1889,"Well, when compared against my old Sony noise canceling ones, these are pathetic.",235
1890,They just won't charge anymore.,235
1891,Absolutely horrible.,235
1892,Am very happy with this purchase.,235
1893,"I'm a college student, and I wanted over-the-ear headphones to wear while I'm doing homework on my computer so I wouldn't be distracted by my surroundings.",235
1894,"Very sturdy, stays on your head.",235
1895,"Also, the padding around the earpieces is quite comfortable and doesn't allow much sound leakage at all.",235
1896,The phone is ok. Not the best mic but for the money they are worth it.,235
1897,The ONLY draw back to these headphones is that if you wear glasses (like I do) it takes some adjusting so that the ear handles of your glasses don't keep the headphones from sitting right...,235
1898,Price comparable to lesser models seen at Wal-Mart and the like.,235
1899,I had the older versions of this headset and they worked great and this one is no exception.,235
1900,The two sound differences these headphones have from the 150s are a) a slightly lower output and b) a slightly lighter bass.,236
1901,Love these and would purchase again.,236
1902,"The sound is clear and of great quality, especially for the price!",236
1903,Definitely recommend!,236
1904,These headphones are definitely better than some but they aren't anything to write home about.,236
1905,Earpieces fold flat for stowing in a backpack.,236
1906,"I didn't expect much for under $20, but if you consider yourself even slightly more concerned with quality than the average user, I'd get something else.",236
1907,Rugged and not heavy.,236
1908,Very good stereo sound.,236
1909,No bass to speak of.,236
1910,"After touching and using the product Kinivo, Arctic, Soundbot ranging from $20 - $36 are going to be about the same quality in sound.",236
1911,"Update 2/11/15 ...

Just bought another set of these.",236
1912,"Personally, they are a little big and don't quite fit.",236
1913,Buy this headphone!,236
1914,"But I knew i needed to upgrade eventually, I mean I can't sit here using a cell phone earpiece as my main set of earbuds, that's ghetto.",236
1915,"He love the audio books and movies available, and raves about the excellent quality of these earphones to everyone.",236
1916,On my PC when I want to use the headphones I just power them up and wait about 10 seconds or so.,236
1917,"They don't have intense bass but I don't really go for that anyway, If you're looking for bass I've seen good reviews for the bass on the Sony MDRZX300.",236
1918,"I was hoping for a headset to listen to music while I do manual work and chores, but it provides so little protection from outside noise that it's nearly useless for that.",236
1919,"I have bought a hundred or hundreds...  of items on Amazon going back to when it was just books... these are very close to the best value for the money that I have ever purchased, period, not just on Amazon.",236
1920,"I doubt they're good enough for a plane, but for a dorm or most bus rides you should be very isolated.",236
1921,"I also have a petite frame and, I assume, smaller head and I have lots of room in these in the back so I imagine they'd for someone with a larger head as well.",236
1922,It is really a shame because the headphones are still good but I cannot use them any more.,236
1923,"My son likes them and orders the same ones, every time.",236
1924,"I am a smallish woman with a small head and small ears and there was no way to wear these comfortably, or even in a way that made them feel they would stay on my ears.",236
1925,"Actually pretty comfortable, which I was worried about with my larger-sized (7 3/8-7 1/2 hat size) noggin.",237
1926,Definitely recommend!,237
1927,Even the 'leather' ear padding (didn't know it came like that.,237
1928,Super comfy because I don't have to shove a plug into my ear.,237
1929,I bought them for around $20 and it was honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made.,237
1930,They are also very easily adjusted and can be changed around to fit your individual measurement.,237
1931,"For the price, Yeh they're worth $15 but not much more.",237
1932,I'm not sure if I'm crazy or not but it makes sense as the right ear is the one with all the controls.,237
1933,Even the 'leather' ear padding (didn't know it came like that.,237
1934,They definitely stick out and I caught quite a few people taking a second glance at me.,237
1935,"What I would suggest the manufacturer for a future version is slightly better looks and amazing noice cancellation, I'd pay 60 dollars also!",237
1936,LIGHT TO HOLD AS WELL.,237
1937,When their parents tell me that their kids lost or broke their $200 dollar headphones I just smile.,237
1938,"Sound:
  Just bought a pair because I left my Alessandro MS-1s at home and am listenning now.",237
1939,She is happy with the headphones.,237
1940,I ordered these to use strictly at my computer because I wanted the household noise to be blocked out.,237
1941,"Hey Joel,

I like the earphones.",237
1942,These can be bought for prices as low as $14 or $12.,237
1943,However if u want to go jogging or bike riding then u may have some connections issues and that is the case for most if not all bluetooth wireless headsets.,237
1944,"When using to talk on a phone call, they have great clarity and work very well.",237
1945,Just a very basic set of headphones.,237
1946,"I don't know if I am in the minority or not on this, but everything I read about headphones is how great they are because people have big heads and ears, well I dont.",237
1947,This is the only headphones my daughter does not break within two weeks.,237
1948,"So, I purchased these headphones 18 months ago and I honestly was happy with them at first.",237
1949,The head set is incredibly comfy and folds up very nicely.,237
1950,People on the other end of the phone can't even tell I'm driving a truck.,238
1951,"This is more the style of the earphone class, and not particular to this model.",238
1952,Not the fault of the manufacturer.),238
1953,The hard plastic of the headphones band does irritates my ears after about 1 hour of use.,238
1954,"My only complaint is that they're described as ""noise cancelling"" and they definitely are not.",238
1955,"Their fashionable as well the finish to the headphones are great, as well as being really comfortable and sturdy- you get the feeling that these aren't going to break.",238
1956,Only and minor complaint is that the plastic band stretches .,238
1957,It is very annoying.,238
1958,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,238
1959,Sony tends to always make good headphones with quality sound.,238
1960,Scares me real bad and is annoying.,238
1961,"I had been searching for days upon days for a headphone, but being the penny pincher that I am I finally found these headphones.",238
1962,-The design of the cushions as well as the tension in the headband make these headphones hard to wear for more than 10 minutes.,238
1963,"The connector is 90 degrees, so if you're looking for a straight connector, this won't do.",238

1968,I was also able to tolerate the behind-the-neck - it only bothers me when I try to stretch my head and neck back which I can live with (although I think I will try top-of-the-head phones next).,238
1969,I use these all the time at work and I think I charge it once or twice a month.,238

1973,I really like these!,238

1991,"Sound is good (not Bose or anything, but I think it is pretty good for listening to Pandora and computer stuff), and they are super confortable.",239
1992,I'm a runner and I've been going through ear bud style headphones like crazy.,239
1993,These lasted me a good year and half before they gave out on me :( They were amazing for the price and will be sorely missed.,239

1995,I've been using this to listen to movies I watch on Netflix on my nook.,239
1996,They have good clear sound reproduction as well they adjust all the way down to fit a smaller child's head with no problem.,239
1997,"You can't use them in loud spaces, on motorized vehicles, God help you if you try to listen to them on the plane.",239
1998,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,239
1999,"The fit is comfortable, the volume doesnt get as loud as you would like but for the price it was a good investment for bluetooth since I cant stand wired headphones.",239
2000,Mid range and bass sound flabby and out of shape causing the highs to sound choppy.,240
2001,"I have dropped them, yanked the cord a few times, though not ridiculously hard...",240
2002,I just picked up the SONY MDR-ZX100 headphones today and for the small amount I paid I can't believe the big sound I am getting with them.,240

2008,They needed charging & so I charged it to full battery & they worked for an hour after turning them on & faded out.,240

2015,"I ordered these headphones for my son, 17 years old, a wrestler.",240
2016,"If you are looking for reasonably priced good quality sound, buy these.",240
2017,But these are the best so far with good highs and lows and bass is good and the treble is about mid range and they work very well with a high end media player too.,240
2018,No matter what brand.,240
2019,"I wouldn't recommend them for DJing or producing, since they do not at all have ""Studio Quality"" sound.",240

2063,I have these in white and they are very good for what I need them.,242
2064,"Overall, I would recommend these to anyone and if these ever break, I will be back for another pair.",242
2065,I bought these headphones for $25 at a local hipster/nerd store that I frequent.,242
2066,"The ear piece is a bit big, but you get an amazing sound from them almost like stereo head srt.",242
2067,So they work best when you only pair them to one device and are very careful not to push the wrong buttons.,242
2068,Folks that ask me about them are amazed at the low price point in comparison to other models.,242
2069,I listen to books on my 12 hour shift and often forget to charge it until it finally begins to die on the third day.,242
2070,"If a phone call comes in, it auto-switches to answer it.",242

2073,"This is an un-necessary glitch for  what I previously considered the best portable blue-tooth headphones, including the unilateral  in-ear-piece models, I have ever owned.",242
2074,I was so excited to try these out considering all the positive reviews.,242
2075,"Overall, they are well worth the money.",243
2076,"I bought these for my dear hubby, at his request.. No personal experience, just his word.",243
2077,I must say you can pay $20.00 more and get the bluetooth Nuclear A/V's off Amazon and be blown away by the sound quality.,243
2078,They are fantastic!,243
2079,"I bought these for my dear hubby, at his request.. No personal experience, just his word.",243
2080,Due to their wireless nature I believe these will be more durable than wired headphones.,243
2081,I recommend these most highly.,243
2082,Great bass sound.,243
2083,"For headphones that cost $14, Sony's WDRZX100 Outdoor Headphones are solid.",243
2084,They have rich deep bass and incredibly clear treble!,243
2085,- Playback controls on the right side for easy and convenient access.,243
2086,The sound-quality when wearing them is clear and even works with bass-heavy* songs.,243
2087,This is my 2nd pair of BTH240 headphones.,243
2088,A lot of reviews compared them to other higher end brand headphones which is unfair in my opinion.,243
2089,The sound quality is very good for the price.,243
2090,"It's tolerable and does not cause a major issue, it's just a minor noticeable thing.",243

2098,"I still battle with hearing people on my end, particularly in a noisy environment.",243
2099,I was tired of having to worry about my headphone cords getting caught under something.,243
2100,"So far, so good.",244
2101,These are perfect for what I need.,244
2102,The latest versions allow you to connect to multiple devices simultaneously.,244
2103,This is my second pair the first worked great and I loved it.,244
2104,I have to sit directly in front of the stereo on the floor to use them.,244
2105,These sound amazing for the price.,244
2106,Perfect for starter headphones before you spend hundreds on others.,244
2107,The two sound differences these headphones have from the 150s are a) a slightly lower output and b) a slightly lighter bass.,244
2108,Always buy new ones!,244
2109,One minor minor complaint for both models are the drivers for the bluetooth on computers needed to be updated for the headsets to work.,244
2110,Pro- It works fine.,244
2111,"So when these were on sale, I figured why not try them.",244
2112,It isn't that bad unless you want the music blasting your ears off in which these won't do.,244
2113,Also the earcups are small and rest on top of the ears rather than covering them.,244
2114,They're loud enough and the bass is deep enough and they have accompanied me through some strenuous and sweaty activities.,244
2115,"I do turn them off when I'm not using them, instead of leaving them in stand-by, so that might have something to do with it.",244
2116,I would have returned it but due to my own fault I purchased them and didn't open the box until after the return window was closed.,244
2117,More comfortable than the 220.,244
2118,Works great to talk through as well.,244
2119,I would have to say that my one complaint is that the cords tangle and twist so it is hard to be comfortable.,244
2120,"They are extremely loud, which is great in a way because you know the button is actually pressed, but at the same time, isn't very appealing when you're listening to something at a low volume or have overly sensitive ears.",244
2121,"the sound is ok, not bad but not great either, it is a little tinny sounding lack of fullness on the lower end.",244
2122,"Sounds beautifully, but the cord is just too short.",244
2123,"The ones I had were actually Sony, and more expensive than these headphones!!!!",244
2124,These are very nice.,244
2125,"Once i put them on, the sound was vivid and very clear.",245
2126,These headphones are also very comfortable and felt great on my head.,245
2127,"to make it even better the microphone is perfect, I took an audio clip with my iPhone's voice recorder and everything was completely clear (granted the house was quiet,) but I had no distortion or anything.",245
2128,"Also keep in mind, because these are behind the ear headphones, if you are leaning back against something, like sitting up in bed or laying down on a pillow, this kind of pushes them forward.",245
2129,These were perfect for that purpose!,245
2130,The Mopw set worked well but was not a great fit (secure wise) but was broken in half when someone moved the couch back up against the computer table.,245
2131,"This may not sound like much to some, but in the world of audio and video, a one second delay makes content nearly unwatchable.",245
2132,If one side just had a nub or braille I'd have a much easier time making sure they were on the right way (and this would also make them friendly for the blind).,245
2133,"The last time this happened, I turned the headphones off and on again, which fixed the issue.",245
2134,Just a note ...,245
2135,"Design features:

Size - I would call these a ""medium"" zize phone.",245
2136,"sorry, slamming this with a one start because it takes a month to ship and no heads up on the description.",245
2137,"All in all, they are priced cheap, but you get a ton of bang for your buck in terms of quality.",245
2138,"My only complaint is that they're not that great at blocking out external noises - on a crowded bus or subway, I have to turn up my volume almost all the way to hear my music properly.",245
2139,"when they arrived, at first look I was worried about the non-adjustability of these because,as a female, my head is kinda small, but they fit OK.",245
2140,Very disappointing.,245
2141,"The size of the speakers (the part that goes on your ear) is a little smaller than I anticipated, but they do tell you the size of the headphones before you buy.",245
2142,They are also great for air travel.,245
2143,"I use both BOSE at home, and this product when I travel.",245
2144,"Some of the button functions, such as play/pause, are not instantaneous.",245
2145,I would strongly recommend paying a little big extra to get quality headphones that you can actually enjoy.,245
2146,"I use them with my iPad, iPhone, laptop and desktop units and they work perfectly, but sometime moving from one device to another can be a bit tricky, but attainable once you get used to them. . . .  bgs.",245
2147,If it turns out that it is just my phone and it works great on other stuff then yeah I would suggest it.,245
2148,This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I bought 'em because of price and the good ratings.,245
2149,"I don't give 5 stars lightly, but this is about as good a deal as I've seen on headphones in a long time.",245
2150,They replaced a large pair of highly rated Photive over the ear Bluetooth phones (which broke) at half the price.,246
2151,I would highly recommend this product.,246
2152,What is there NOT to like??,246
2153,I like the headphones and they're reasonably good for sound.,246
2154,"As of today July 9, 2016 they will not hold a charge.",246
2155,Quality build you'd expect from Sony as well as quality sound.,246
2156,"It also works if your phone is left in the car while you get gas, etc.",246
2157,"These are really affordable headphones, nice and loud with decent bass.",246
2158,Mids and highs are great now.,246
2159,I trust and love Kiniv.,246
2160,This is definitely worth your money,246
2161,I was worried about the sound quality but there is bass and everything seems well balanced.,246
2162,The white is pretty classy in my opinion.,246
2163,I am returning them and buying a new pair once more hopefully these will not cut in and out.,246
2164,I was skeptical getting these as I'm coming from having Rocket Fish bluetooth headphones.,246
2165,"I've purchased some other headphones in this price range that have served me well, but I don't think these would make it a week.",246
2166,8.5/10 - Bass heavy and get uncomfortable,246
2167,I must say my head is all of 71/2 in.,246
2168,"Most importantly though, the price point is great and I can run, lift weights, and shoot hoops in these just fine.",246
2169,The build is also excellent as it has structurally held up nicely.,246
2170,This headset sits slightly awkward during running but stays on for a while.,246
2171,"This meant that I couldn't hear very well because the sound wasn't actually directed into my ear, but more into the lobe region of my ear.",246
2172,I don't wear them for more than a couple hours.,246
2173,They can get pretty loud.,246
2174,If you can find the right sized replacement.,246
2175,I think that for the average person who listens to pop or rock will  get the right kick out of these.,247
2176,I was pleased that my headphones had arrived ahead of schedule.,247
2177,after first workout they of course got sweaty and to my shock the cushion for ear came off.,247
2178,This seems to be common for a lot of these inexpensive headsets.,247
2179,For the price these are great headphones upon first impressions much better sound and build quality then a pair of Walmart brand for the same price.,247
2180,"Headband pads can be bought, but the hot water pipe insulation was all I had available at the time.",247
2181,I bought these because the wire on a similar set of headphones broke.,247
2182,"My only complaint about these is that they emphasize bass a little too much, but they're definitely a solid option if you're looking for an inexpensive set of headphones for your office or when you're on the subway.",247
2183,I need a little tighter fit to make them a 5 star rating.,247
2184,I'm rough on headphones.,247
2185,He listens to a lot of classic rock so the 1st song he listened to was Kashmir by Led Zeppelin and he said it sounded phenomenal!,247
2186,How do they do it for that price?,247
2187,"My only complaint about these is that they emphasize bass a little too much, but they're definitely a solid option if you're looking for an inexpensive set of headphones for your office or when you're on the subway.",247
2188,Easy to set up and control.,247
2189,I tethered the locking velvet pouch to the outside of my back-pack for easy access and to keep them safe from my textbooks.,247
2190,"I've had these for two days now, and I love them.",247
2191,You have to add this to your collection.,247
2192,"When pulling the plug from the headphone jack, i have to pinch the rubber casing to prevent it from pulling apart further.",247
2193,"they are simple yet elegent, they have a outstanding base, and are incredebly comfortable.",247
2194,"Panasonic RP-HT21, no question, every single time.",247
2195,"The same piece is used on other cheap headsets I have gotten from competing companies, so I believe it is a commodity part.",247
2196,"But, they just mean you can hear the cord moving when the headphones are on, and it's not even a problem.",247
2197,Then finally the exterior bridge that holds the phones on the bar broke.,247
2198,"The microphone in the headset picked her voice up very well, I was extremely surprised how well actually.",247
2199,So definitely satisfied with these so far.,247
2200,"Though I did receive comments on the receiving end that it was a bit soft, and with Skype Echo testing it sounded fine to me (although a bit flat, but I am not planning on using this mic for any karaoke).",248
2201,But I can't figure out how to adjust skype on Ubuntu with it.,248
2202,Did I mention that they run for a very long play at peak volumne and they fold up nicely?,248
2203,"Its sturdy and can withstand abuse (tossing it onto the table, for example) and the wires are thicker than your average $5 headphones.",248
2204,"I bought this obviously for 3 reasons: cheap price, positive average reviews, and the brand.",248
2205,"The more I try using other pairs of headphones or earbuds, the more I appreciate just how good these Sony headphones are.",248
2206,These are great for driving and working in the yard when you don't want to be handling your phone.,248
2207,"They do get minorly uncomfortable after about an hour straight of them being on, but then again what headphones don't!",248
2208,I originally bought this for a friend since we skype a lot.,248
2209,Finally figured out that they hook over your ears besides going behind your neck.,248
2210,(Very similar to the Dell version I bought about 5 years ago for $60.),248
2211,I like that they don't pinch and still stays on when I run or mountain bike.,248
2212,"I have used them on a run, several times at the gym and to walk my dog.",248
2213,"they do hurt my ears if i wear them for too long, but they are my first pair of over ear headphones, so i could be wearing them weirdly, idk lol",248
2214,"You can bring these up to passable by boosting the treble, but if you're using a device that has no EQ control beyond bass boost they're going to sound very muffled

The insulating pads.",248
2215,Great bass sound.,248
2216,Hope this helps and shop smart.,248
2217,The white makes them fun too.,248
2218,These things are great.,248
2219,My daughter loves them.,248
2220,The Mopw set worked well but was not a great fit (secure wise) but was broken in half when someone moved the couch back up against the computer table.,248
2221,Quality build you'd expect from Sony as well as quality sound.,248
2222,Stretching them out helps for a while but even the loosest setting was not enough for me.,248
2223,I have had mine for about two years and they are in perfect quality.,248
2224,"Sound, comfort ex.",248
2225,"Personally, they are a little big and don't quite fit.",249
2226,"Fast forward to two years ago, and I pick up another pair of these, but in white, since the others had the rip and the white looked cool.",249
2227,"UPDATE: After a couple years of being dropped, stepped on, and listened to, these still work.",249
2228,"I have only had the headphones for a day, but I am impressed.",249
2229,"The headphone is functioning properly,good sound,good mic reception, easy to configure.",249
2230,so if you are looking for good audio that won't dent your wallet you can always count on these sony headphone to deliver.,249
2231,they fold up and fit nicely in his backpack.,249
2232,"So I sleep in these things, I stand up forgetting their on and yank the cord hard.. it gets stepped on sat on twisted... water all over them.",249
2233,"Oh, and if you have a big head don't even bother.",249
2234,They sat for another 6 months until I got around to fixing them.,249
2235,These work just as well.,249
2236,"Only trouble is, the white gets dirty very easily.",249
2237,"The Sony ZX100 Over-the-Ear headphone with 30mm driver has about 24 ohms of resistance, requiring 50% more power to operate, but produces a more crisper sound response.",249
2238,My mothers pair have stopped working after about a year.,249
2239,"I have a large head, and it fits me really well.",249
2240,I bought these because the wire on a similar set of headphones broke.,249
2241,I was surprised on how good the bass was (for twenty something bucks).,249
2242,"PROS: Perfect for any mp3 player, tablet, audio device, and computer using a 3.5mm audio jack (virtually all mainstream devices do).",249
2243,"They looked all right during the purchase, but after receiving it and actually wearing it to and from the gym, I have to honestly say they're not the coolest of things.",249
2244,"The audio sounds great, it holds a charge for a very long time, and paired immediately.",249
2245,ALSO it came in black-not white.,249
2246,Very dissapointing!,249
2247,"I wouldn't recommend them for hardcore music or gaming, but they're not really designed for that anyway.",249
2248,The units fit snuggly behind my ears providing clear listening and comfort.,249
2249,This was a good buy.,249
2250,I plan on buying another pair soon.,250
2251,They simply hurt my ears after short periods of time.,250
2252,I gave these a try based upon the good reviews.,250
2253,Would rather buy it for $10 instead of $15.,250
2254,I though it was kool that i was jamming out to Iheart radio at the gym the other day and my song pauses and i hear thing ringing and push the ear piece answer button on the side of the head phones and a super clear hands free phone call.,250
2255,No single frequency range dominates.,250
2256,Well worth the price.,250
2257,"I guess I had higher expectations for these headphones, but a regular old pair of ear buds that you would think were lower quality lasted me longer.",250
2258,The headphones arrived quickly and worked well.,250
2259,These headphones are also very comfortable and felt great on my head.,250
2260,The sound is spectacular!,250
2261,These headphones were a very comfortable fit for me and have remained durable even after being carelessly handled several times.,250
2262,I looked at the manufacturer's photos and I am wearing them properly.,250
2263,They bounce just slightly when on a run but will not fall off.,250
2264,I do understand that these are on ear headphones with small drivers.,250
2265,For only 15-20$ you absolutely cannot go wrong.,250
2266,Bluetooth should work within 30 feet.,250
2267,"the sound is ok, not bad but not great either, it is a little tinny sounding lack of fullness on the lower end.",250
2268,They block background noise well!,250
2269,UPDATE 12 JUN 2015 - My headphones are completely dead now.,250
2270,The chord isn't even compromised.,250
2271,Great for the money!,250
2272,The Sony head phones are amazing.,250
2273,Finally figured out that they hook over your ears besides going behind your neck.,250
2274,It is way worse with the Watch.,250
2275,It was with reservation that I tried this one from Kinivo.,251
2276,"The sound is great, and mind you I do use them daily, but within 5 months of purchase, both sides of the headset are dead.",251
2277,"They're a little big at the back, so when I lay flat it does get pushed a bit, but not uncomfortably so.",251
2278,The power switch failed mechanically.,251
2279,The sound is about as good as you can expect for $15.,251
2280,He is absolutely in love with these.,251
2281,I usually only do it after shirts vs skins basketball games when I do an impromptu press conference or I Kanye Weat my pastor of the church to talk about Beyonce's gospel album.,251
2282,"Great product here, Kinivo!",251
2283,"It's been a while since I bought some over ear headphones... and let me say that I love headphones, and while I love my music, I wouldn't say that I could qualify as a true audiophile.",251
2284,"durable on the touch feeling
easy access, fast connect with bluetooth
comfortable on ears
looks like premium product with cheap price
worth every penny",251
2285,**the instruction book that comes with the headset specifies the A2DP setting and once i figured out how to set that properly i've had no issues.,251
2286,If that could get fixed I'd love these.,251
2287,"Its sturdy and can withstand abuse (tossing it onto the table, for example) and the wires are thicker than your average $5 headphones.",251
2288,The sound is good as well.,251
2289,"My first pair that I bought years ago stopped holding a charge, so I switched brands.",251
2290,- Playback controls on the right side for easy and convenient access.,251
2291,came securely and professionally packaged.,251
2292,Bought these for my son for Christmas.,251
2293,"The plastic is just porous enough to take to sharpies, paint markers, and stickers, so you can customize them to your heart's content.",251
2294,This headset was exactly what I needed!,251
2295,While the rest of the gym endures the noise bleed through their earbuds I'm deep in stereo bliss.,251
2296,The new ones feel cheaper - including thinner and shorter cable.,251
2297,"Clear, high quality sound and sturdy construction.",251
2298,"You can fold the ears of the headphones, too.",251
2299,Hope this review isn't to confusing and if you have questions please ask!,251
2300,I used them all day long for conference calls while I walk around my office untethered.,252
2301,They could even add $2 to the price without ruining the great value of them.,252
2302,For a great price!,252
2303,So that means they still need to improve the microphones on the stereo headsets.,252
2304,I wasn't looking to match the sound of my top of the line wired units but I was very pleased when these arrived and I put them to use.,252
2305,"The more I try using other pairs of headphones or earbuds, the more I appreciate just how good these Sony headphones are.",252
2306,"to make it even better the microphone is perfect, I took an audio clip with my iPhone's voice recorder and everything was completely clear (granted the house was quiet,) but I had no distortion or anything.",252
2307,I like the headphones and they're reasonably good for sound.,252
2308,I use these as work headphones along with a mp3 player.,252
2309,"I thought it was just me, but both my brother and my mother had the same problem as well.",252
2310,It's been 4 years since i've bought them and they are still going strong!,252
2311,I gave these 5-stars because they exceeded my expectations at any price.,252
2312,It's so damn uncomfortable.,252
2313,"You can fold the ears of the headphones, too.",252
2314,I'm sure others like this option but it does not fit my needs.,252
2315,"It works great for that, as long is it only used for a short period.",252
2316,I'm not sure if its the brand or where I got it from but BUYER BEWARE!,252
2317,Reasonably comfortable and pretty good sound.,252
2318,Excellent value!,252
2319,Not sure if the issue is rough use or manufacturing.,252
2320,My son wanted these so he got them.,252
2321,"UPDATE: After a couple years of being dropped, stepped on, and listened to, these still work.",252
2322,I have been constantly using it for over 10 months now and it still charges as new and has the same sound quality ... !,252
2323,Very happy with this product.,252
2324,They looked comfortable and were made by Sony which is a tried and true brand that I completely trust.,252
2325,I feel like a little more width around back might help give a better angle that wouldn't pinch my ears.,253
2326,These are Sony and at about $15 it's a steal so I went a head and got them.,253
2327,This is a great product!!!,253
2328,Not a bad price either.,253
2329,"All in all, I would highly recommend these headphones and have recommended them to friends on several occasions.",253
2330,I have used the bth220 model for the past year and love them but wanted a second pair.,253
2331,They are comfortable.,253
2332,Very disappointing.,253
2333,Also the earcups are small and rest on top of the ears rather than covering them.,253
2334,Good quality sound for a half-decent price.,253
2335,Does not drop signal continuously.,253
2336,"If you're looking for a solid set of 'phones at a low price, you simply can't do better than this.",253
2337,"Excellent headset for price, very comfortable.",253
2338,I should have bought two of these.,253
2339,"I have been told by the parties on the receiving end that I can be heard better using these than using just the cell, or the cell with earbuds and mic.",253
2340,"But I knew i needed to upgrade eventually, I mean I can't sit here using a cell phone earpiece as my main set of earbuds, that's ghetto.",253
2341,"The unit connects well to my Samsung phone, good sound, etc.",253
2342,A really great buy!,253
2343,I've had a pair of these (white) for three years and they are still going strong.,253
2344,:)  These push against my cartilage after a while.,253
2345,The cushions are comfy and the wires are strong.,253
2346,"They are not noise canceling and they don't block much sound out, which is fine unless you are in a noisy environment.",253
2347,The cord is long enough for me.,253
2348,Been using it like 6 or 7 hours while I jog and no problem so far.,253
2349,"Since it just sits on your ears, however, sound will leak if the volume is on really really high.",253
2350,"I received these on time and have only had them a few days, but they have worked great.",254
2351,"These work really well (not perfect) with my iPhone 5, MapMyFitness, and my Fitletic Race Belt.",254
2352,"Good range, love not being tethered to my phone, and can still listen to my music from two rooms away.",254
2353,I am an editor and I use these for simple editing in coffee shops.,254
2354,I was also able to tolerate the behind-the-neck - it only bothers me when I try to stretch my head and neck back which I can live with (although I think I will try top-of-the-head phones next).,254
2355,They had offered to send me out a new pair.,254
2356,The range isn't too bad either.,254
2357,Then I realized it was supposed to be put on behind the neck.,254
2358,"My son has autism so he is super picky about products he uses, and he really likes this one.. Super fast shipping!",254
2359,"If you want the best sound and bass, don't be an insufferable cheap bstard and buy bose or beats.",254
2360,The button changes don't improve or worsen my review.,254
2361,It's not a big difference -- it took several back-and-forths to pin it down --  but it is noticeable.,254
2362,"Also, the sound was fine, but wasn't near the quality of my $30 Sony headphones that were wired.",254
2363,Cord is really short - come on Sony!,254
2364,"Occasionally there is an odd distortion when connected to my computer, but a quick disconnect and reconnect fixes it.",254
2365,"Haven't tested them out as a hands-free set or for streaming music from another device (iPad, etc.).",254
2366,"The good, the bad, and the ugly:
Good- great ergonomic design, very nice feeling on the ears.",254
2367,I've purchased three pairs of these for my kids (two pairs in white/pink and one in blue/black).,254
2368,"Not noticeable at first, but you have to pay attention.",254
2369,"I received a 3.5mm male jack, but have easily fixed this foible with an adapter for $0.90.",254
2370,I tried to like these.,254
2371,I tried running with it but it just didn't work out for me since it wasn't as snug as a fit as I had wanted.,254
2372,The cord length is good.,254
2373,"These are listed for children, but fit my head perfectly, and the sound is great.",254
2374,"Out of the box before even charging, this just paired with my Samsung Galaxy S3 instantly.",254
2375,The only negative is the strap around the head is not adjustable and stiff.,255
2376,The sound quality is outstanding as well.,255
2377,"Battery last all day, it's great!",255
2378,so if you are looking for good audio that won't dent your wallet you can always count on these sony headphone to deliver.,255
2379,"For those of you don't need the volume up quite as high like for walking or watching a dvd in a car, etc.",255
2380,Every so often they start to cut out even if my phone is in my hand or nearby.,255
2381,i have seen the same review given by other people and it seems that they make this headphones just to rob money from people.,255
2382,I have been using these for months at work everyday for 8 hours.,255
2383,Bought these for my 8yr old son to use on his ipad so i don't have to listen to his games/music in the car.,255
2384,I wanted wireless to minimize the clutter on my body when I go out for the ride.,255
2385,The sound quality is biased towards the bass side of neutral which is not my preference - but we are discussing $14.00 phones!,255
2386,I'm really happy with this product.,255
2387,I do wear glasses but have had no problem with other headphones.,255
2388,I don't have a little head either.,255
2389,Just note that isolation is nonexistant on this one.,255
2390,They give a really nice sound experience INMHO especially for being fairly inexpensive headphones.,255
2391,So I'll use them until they inevitably break...which they quickly will given the crappy cords they're equipped with...and then I'll go to Best Buy and purchase some more real ones at a higher price.,255
2392,"As for the cups themselves, they have a nice cushion.",255
2393,My eight and six year old got them for Christmas and they use them all of the time.,255
2394,How you can get this much quality for such a low price.,255
2395,I bought these for use on an airplane to shut out external sounds a bit.,255
2396,I need head phones to listen to my ipod.,255
2397,"If you want a headset with with high bass, go for something else.",255
2398,They are comfortable.,255
2399,I use these daily and love them!,255
2400,It sticks out and just dangles in the air like a wild hair.,256
2401,"RED is RIGHT; it makes it easy to know which way to wear the headphones, without looking for the tiny ""R"" and ""L.""",256
2402,Just no comparison in my opinion.,256
2403,"What's more, you can't watch video with them unless you're okay with the audio and video not being synchronized.",256
2404,"I mentioned that I used my TV - on the back it has a headphone out jack and I picked up a ""monoprice bluetooth splitter"" (those are your search words).",256
2405,"However, the Kinivo BTH240 pair up every time, no matter what device I am connecting them to...and for a $30 device, this is impressive.",256
2406,"as far as fit and comfort is pretty good considering I have a large head

only con is its not blue tooth 4.0 or bertter",256
2407,Battery last a lot too!,256
2408,I think they're pretty good considering I only paid about $30 for them.,256
2409,Both sets died within a week of each other.,256
2410,The units fit snuggly behind my ears providing clear listening and comfort.,256
2411,I use these with my iPhone.,256
2412,"So far I'm not having any problems with one-side going out, no strange noises.",256
2413,"For the price, great deal.",256
2414,I bought them because reviews on amazon said they were of the same quality of Beats by Dre.,256
2415,It syncs with my Galaxy Note 3 easily allowing me freedom from wires.,256
2416,"Turn on the head set, it connects up via the adapter, and switches my audio out to the headset.",256
2417,It's so damn uncomfortable.,256
2418,I also use them to listen to iHeart Radio from my iPhone.,256
2419,These aren't anything special.,256
2420,Blocks some subway noice but i can still hesr the train.,256
2421,You can't see that in the picture.,256
2422,Be mindful of this if you have a bigger head.,256
2423,I would have to say that my one complaint is that the cords tangle and twist so it is hard to be comfortable.,256
2424,Other than that they fit good around my ears and drown out other sounds'.,256
2425,The pause works great.,257
2426,Also whenever there is high bass the left side begins to rattle badly which disrupts my music.,257
2427,"My son likes them and orders the same ones, every time.",257
2428,Thinkin about ordering another pair for home.,257
2429,They are awesome!,257
2430,"I based my purchasing decisions largely on other reviews, which led to believe that the sound quality was better than it actually is..",257
2431,"Pros: comfortable fit, relatively lightweight for being larger headphones, great sound quality, easy to wear and easy to use; noise canceling ""enough"" for the price!",257
2432,"They are not really noise cancelling, but are effective and comfortable.",257
2433,"What I like - inexpensive, fits comfortably, syncing easily with Apple products, inexpensive, lightweight, comes with bag, inexpensive, buttons are accessible, stays put while running, buttons are logical, and inexpensive.",257
2434,I have used them all week at the gym and they are the best!,257
2435,"I would say that it is likely just do to the fact that I am small and have a narrow head, but it is still annoying none the less.",257
2436,"After four years of use, I have not once regretted purchasing these headphones.",257
2437,Couldn't ask for anything better!,257
2438,I like how they came with a travel pouch/ bag.,257
2439,"I'm a college student, and I wanted over-the-ear headphones to wear while I'm doing homework on my computer so I wouldn't be distracted by my surroundings.",257
2440,"I had been searching for days upon days for a headphone, but being the penny pincher that I am I finally found these headphones.",257
2441,Awesome BT headphones for a reasonable price.,257
2442,He can wear his helmet while riding his bike and still use these to listen to music.,257
2443,"Overall they are probably better for ST listening, not something you could fall asleep in.",257
2444,Now I still have to buy another headset.,257
2445,"they do hurt my ears if i wear them for too long, but they are my first pair of over ear headphones, so i could be wearing them weirdly, idk lol",257
2446,"Next is the sound, which is very good.",257
2447,"Of course they do not get as good sound as my Beats by Dr. Dre Studio's, but great overall value.",257
2448,these are at a great price and work great i think i may buy another pair.. the only thing that takes a little getting use to is the behind the neck idea.. but other than that they have a great sound quality and an even greater price....,257
2449,Got the headphones for my son as throw aways because he is very hard on headsets.,257
2450,I would purchase these again.,258
2451,"They arrived quickly, are simple and intuitive to use and sound good and last a good while before needing to be recharged.",258
2452,I'm not sure exactly how far it is ... maybe 60-75 feet or so ... far enough to be able to get a drink or go grab some equipment without having to move my phone.,258
2453,She can wait until she is older for the headphones that cost 10 times the price.,258
2454,I got one for my self then got two more for family.,258
2455,He blows through earbuds like they are nothing!,258
2456,"They're small and would be a great size for a child, the sound quality is ok, it sounds a bit low and the bass isn't much, it doesn't sound like the 20$ sony headphones, this pair would be a step down from that.",258
2457,"Daughter's gave out a week ago, so they lasted about 8 months.",258
2458,"I've generally been happy with the Sony products I've used, but often found them a bit pricier than similar options.",258
2459,"Very clear sound, comfortable and light weight.",258
2460,"A small thing, but worth noting?",258
2461,A great purchase for a reasonable price.,258
2462,"Note that these are the sports-type of headphones, and instead of going over the top of the head, they go behind the neck.",258
2463,He states that the quality of sound is very good coming from the headphones and I tried them as well and I actually like them a lot better than my J Lab in ear headphones.,258
2464,I have a pair of white ones that are running 2 years strong right now!,258
2465,"These did the trick, and for less than 20 dollars.",258
2466,"The audio quality is superb, but that does not amount to much if you can't stand to wear them.",258
2467,In the sound department they're both great and I have no issue with that.,258
2468,They addressed my issue immediately and issued a refund.,258
2469,Great value and performance.,258
2470,Highly recommended.,258
2471,"I am a little rough with on my stuff at times and this feels like it is ""me proof"".",258
2472,Very inconvenient.,258
2473,He is constantly taking phone calls as well.,258
2474,"Now, these headphones will not blow you away in terms of audio performance, and this was not the reason that I purchased and/or love them.",258
2475,They don't hug my head too tightly (where I might get a headache).,259
2476,Love these and would purchase again.,259
2477,I listen to the audio books from my IPhone and I Pad.,259
2478,Item shipped and was delivered quickly.,259
2479,I am using it with my nano touch.,259
2480,I bought it almost one year ago and have been wearing them to gym and outdoor cycling.,259
2481,I like that they don't pinch and still stays on when I run or mountain bike.,259
2482,"If you want to try Bluetooth headphones but don't want to spend a lot, these are for you.",259
2483,"I bought the new one because I lost the other ones again, and I wanted a separate pair for work.",259
2484,"Sound is balanced, not too much of anything (so the bass wasn't that good for electronic music and such, but it was there)but a little muffled.",259
2485,Bought these for my 8yr old son to use on his ipad so i don't have to listen to his games/music in the car.,259
2486,That may have more to do with my big noggin than anything else.,259
2487,Sound isn't high enough and there's NO BASS at all.,259
2488,"So if you have physically sensitive outer ears, you might want to look at a different style.",259
2489,"She liked that they were easy to put on, and the price.",259
2490,"Overall, I highly recommend them for the average listener, but not for the audiophile snob types.",259
2491,"You can use it on your Computer ""Mac or PC"" or on your cellphone.",259
2492,I purchased a headset before these for 11 dollars and the connection on those were beyond better than the kinivo set.,259
2493,I'm thinking there is a way to push a button or something to access the phone (Siri) but I have pressed all the buttons and still haven't been successful.,259
2494,"that I woke someone up by calling them at a bad hour, I knew these were unacceptable.",259
2495,I have used these headphones on several runs and in the gym a few times now and I must say that I am quite impressed.,259
2496,"RED is RIGHT; it makes it easy to know which way to wear the headphones, without looking for the tiny ""R"" and ""L.""",259
2497,"I have more expensive on-ear and over-ear headphones for at-home listening or music production, but I didn't want to use them for outdoor activities for obvious reasons.",259
2498,Not a DJ-ing headset because of it's it limited mobility.,259
2499,"Turn on the head set, it connects up via the adapter, and switches my audio out to the headset.",259
2500,I must say you can pay $20.00 more and get the bluetooth Nuclear A/V's off Amazon and be blown away by the sound quality.,260
2501,"Overall, they are well worth the money.",260
2502,I would turn my music up and the music just sounded like it needed to be louder with the headphones and they werent.,260
2503,Then if you lost it you would have to buy another otherwise you couldn't charge the headphones?,260
2504,It's not a big difference -- it took several back-and-forths to pin it down --  but it is noticeable.,260
2505,"Yes, I would recommend this product.",260
2506,"If you want cheap headphones to just throw on, go for it.",260
2507,"The headphones work with the tablet these were purchased for, what else can you ask for.",260
2508,"Listen to the reviews and you'll know that this is not for someone who wants ""top of the line"" quality and base pounding headphones.",260
2509,"The headphones work with the tablet these were purchased for, what else can you ask for.",260
2510,"I had to run the last 3 miles without my auditory motivation, which I absolutely hated.",260
2511,"RED is RIGHT; it makes it easy to know which way to wear the headphones, without looking for the tiny ""R"" and ""L.""",260
2512,"Really Sony, 3 ft?",260
2513,For a great price!,260
2514,Guess these might not be all that cool I guess I really don't know but if you are a pork and beaner and looking for about the best $30 dollar item in the whole world this may very well be it.,260
2515,The sound is good but the headband is so tight it gives my kids headaches.,260
2516,"I finally gave these to my granddaughter, I don't think she uses them, hers had mickey mouse or something on them making even them better than bth240 headphones.",260
2517,I've purchased three pairs of these for my kids (two pairs in white/pink and one in blue/black).,260
2518,I recommend the vendor and the headphones.,260
2519,Bluetooth connectivity sometimes buggy with iphones.,260
2520,I did not get comfort.,260
2521,Sound Quality (4 stars): Sound quality is enjoyable.,260
2522,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,260
2523,I highly recommend these to anyone!,260
2524,There was some disconnection when using this outside while shooting hoops.,260
2525,Fit is fair too.,261
2526,They look like they belong with the iphone super good looking and solid Sony quality.,261
2527,"They were easy to connect to my iPad, and sound good and have pretty good range.",261
2528,"I bought it for my son, he loves it.",261
2529,He has nothing but great things to say about this product.,261
2530,"Their fashionable as well the finish to the headphones are great, as well as being really comfortable and sturdy- you get the feeling that these aren't going to break.",261
2531,They fit  a little tight at first but I got used to them.,261
2532,Incoming phone call?,261
2533,Great headphones and a great price.,261
2534,This headphone meets my expectation for its price.,261
2535,"The same piece is used on other cheap headsets I have gotten from competing companies, so I believe it is a commodity part.",261
2536,Bought them as gifts for directors who were competing at a marching band event and they loved them!!!,261
2537,Clear sound and good microphone.,261
2538,"CONS---
There are none, I'm happy to report.",261
2539,"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.",261
2540,"Of course they do not get as good sound as my Beats by Dr. Dre Studio's, but great overall value.",261
2541,Also no static at all.,261
2542,They are exactly like the picture looks.,261
2543,I was searching high and low for bluetooth wireless headphones to use with my iPhone and iPod.,261
2544,"I tried them also, they sound ok for a budget price set.",261
2545,Ripped it apart and installed in some better headphones.,261
2546,"(Anyway, these puppies look nerdy enough on your ears; if anyone saw you speaking into the ether with them on they'd wonder where your aluminum foil cap was.)",261
2547,I wear glasses and its just a quick adjustment when putting them on to compensate for over the ear wearing.,261
2548,It's easy to set up and having all the controls on one of headphones is a big plus.,261
2549,"My husband ordered them for me, and I won't wear them.",261
2550,Being able to hear in both ears is a great experience.,262
2551,They cover your ears well and are adjustable.,262
2552,"After a time, they do become a bit uncomfortable due to the tighter squeeze than an over the head style of headphones involve.",262
2553,I am also very happy with Kinivo's customer service.,262
2554,After hrs of research I decided this was the headset for me...,262
2555,Haven't needed to charge the battery again yet.,262
2556,They worked great and lasted at least a year.,262
2557,However the ear piece is really soft so that balance out the tight grip.,262
2558,"If you want to try Bluetooth headphones but don't want to spend a lot, these are for you.",262
2559,We use the new set for audio and phone calls only.,262
2560,"They would no longer hold a charge so I upgraded to this model, the BTH240.",262
2561,I am a bit of an audiophile and purchased MDRZX100/White for a non-music related work.,262
2562,I like the thick cord.,262
2563,I'm pretty sure its the connection between the wires and the 3.5 mm plug.,262
2564,This was even better then the original one I had .,262
2565,"BTW, the 220's will still hold a charge perfectly.",262
2566,"Once the call ended, the music came right back.",262
2567,I purchased the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo headphones specifically for walking/running while wearing sunglasses.,262
2568,Folds up neatly for travelling.,262
2569,These seem to have some static and a distinct lack of bass.,262
2570,"THE PAIR in question even with the mentioned issues, play perfectly fine out of both sides and still sound pretty damn good ...",262
2571,"They're low priced, but get the job done.",262
2572,Another issue is the swivel on these.,262
2573,I just didn't take it upon myself to actually see what that size would be.,262
2574,"Over the years, the cushion that rests on your years has turned into flakes so now I have the sponge material left over.",262
2575,"All I can say they are better than the more expensive phones I bought elsewhere on line that were called the deal of the day
Update: thin material on the foam earphones flakes off little by little leaving white speckles on your ears.",263
2576,The headphones arrived on time and in good shape.,263
2577,I purchased these in 2011 and are finally starting to reach the end of its life after 5 years of hardcore gym use and constant sweating in.,263
2578,I trust and love Kiniv.,263
2579,Wondering how long before it breaks but I'm guessing it will really last...hahaha.,263
2580,Only draw back is when they're on people can hear the music you're playing and I was looking for a pair of headphones that I can use while my son is napping or in the bed while I'm working during the wee hours.,263
2581,"If you're like me and listen to music or movies occasionally, these are perfect.",263
2582,The transaction was smooth and the shipping was fast!,263
2583,"After almost 3 and a half years they still do their job perfectly, just some missing chrome from the track/volume buttons and the outer skin of the pads peeling off.",263
2584,Sony tends to always make good headphones with quality sound.,263
2585,features - the 3.5mm jack is molded with a 90 angle.,263
2586,"If you have a big head, stay away, they will fall off.",263
2587,Build quality is decent.,263
2588,They are very durable and have a nice sound quality.,263
2589,"Because kids are using them, I don't want to spend a lot, but I want them to hold up a little while.",263
2590,These little headphones are great so far!,263
2591,Like so many other reviews at $30 there is little room to nitpick; even if I get better headphones this will surely remain as a sportswear set.,263
2592,I'm just a reg joe and I also have a pair of boss and a pair of beats.... but I use these for work and I bring them home so the kids use.....,263
2593,The music comes back up at the volume level that you were listening to prior to the call.,263
2594,I was very disapointed with the sound - needs more treble!,263
2595,Light an fit his little ears and head with no problem.,263
2596,"Basically, I take VOIP calls/meetings now and I don't have to use my desk phone/home phone / cell phone.",263
2597,We bought these for use on the computer with our 8 year old.,263
2598,"Needless to say, I am returning this item.",263
2599,"Actual, serious physical pain and burning of my ears.",263
2600,I decided to buy a pair of over the ear headphones and saw these at a reasonable price.,264
2601,We could hardly hear it.,264
2602,Great little fella.,264
2603,"I mainly use my headphones at the gym, watching videos on the elliptical machine and listening to music while working out.",264
2604,Body is excellent.,264
2605,I use it for biking to work and listening to music or podcasts.,264
2606,"When I listen to all my favorite song's the  sound's on this Sony stereo headphone's are great you can hear the music more,it tune's out any other sound around you.",264
2607,Wish they fit a bit tighter though.,264
2608,I suppose I was expecting too much at this price range!,264
2609,"Don't expect what you might hear from 200-300 dollar headphones, but these are well worth the money!",264
2610,Highly recommend!,264
2611,They work great and are durable (my son uses them for the computer lab at school).,264
2612,These are great quality for such a low price.,264
2613,These are great for any  music of mine!,264
2614,"This may not sound like much to some, but in the world of audio and video, a one second delay makes content nearly unwatchable.",264
2615,Use them mostly for listening to music.,264
2616,"Look, you are getting what you are paying.",264
2617,It's not like the professional ones but it is great quality for the price and it may just last longer for me than my Behringer ones that only lasted a year and I payed more for!,264
2618,"I purchased these headphones to be able to listen to music on my iPhone, and take and make phone calls as well as to stream music through either my Mac Book Air or iMac.",264
2619,"These are lightweight, don't crush my head, decent sound and the cord is just the right length.",264
2620,I have a small head and have never really liked ear buds because they make my ears really sore after a short time.,264
2621,Overalls great set if having chords is really not possible for you,264
2622,I've used these for over a year now.,264
2623,Just make sure you don't push it and you'll be fine.,264
2624,"If you sit or lay in absolute darkness, they can light up half the room lol.",264
2625,"However, if you want to use these headphones to eavesdrop on people, it's a five-star product.",265
2626,"I bought them for my 13 year old son, so his stupid games on his stupid tablet don't annoy me (smiley face).",265
2627,And I that goes for the two pair that I bought so I know that it wasn't just a lemon that I got.,265
2628,I was tired of having to worry about my headphone cords getting caught under something.,265
2629,I'll update this review in a few months when they're good and burned in and I get them away from him for a bit to listen again.,265
2630,This headset sits slightly awkward during running but stays on for a while.,265
2631,These sound really good.,265
2632,These head phones have worked like charm.,265
2633,They addressed my issue immediately and issued a refund.,265
2634,"Occasionally there is an odd distortion when connected to my computer, but a quick disconnect and reconnect fixes it.",265
2635,Being able to hear in both ears is a great experience.,265
2636,It does not fit to charge it!,265
2637,Arrived earlier than expected.,265
2638,"I used to use cheap wired headphones to listen to my podcasts, I would go through a pair a month, these have lasted me 8 months so it's a great value.",265
2639,I bought these for workouts but sadly they are way too bulky.,265
2640,It also appears that the noise cancellation logic struggles when the input signal is low.,265
2641,"However, they are not comfortable for children or people who have slightly smaller heads.",265
2642,They are painful if you wear them very long.,265
2643,I bought these for an auditory discrimination program for my son's therapy.,265
2644,Loose the wires!,265
2645,You would be disappointed.,265
2646,"There is sound when plugged into my phone, but even with adapters purchased at a local electronic store, I have not been able to get them to work with my computer or TV.",265
2647,Bought some Sony wireless headphones for Christmas this year.,265
2648,My wife has been using BTH 220 for 2 years without any issue so i decided to order the newer version.,265
2649,"It presses into the top of your head no matter how you adjust it, which makes watching movies or multiple episodes of a show with them extremely unpleasant.",265
2650,"These are good, inexpensive general purpose headphones.",266
2651,"For example, if I put my phone in my front left pocket and walk then the connection has a tendency to break up in time to my steps.",266
2652,I got a pair of MDR-NC7 for about what I paid for the MDR-ZX100s I'm reviewing here.,266
2653,Then if you lost it you would have to buy another otherwise you couldn't charge the headphones?,266
2654,I've love the way this headset works with my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.,266
2655,I wish I would have spent a bit more money and purchased ones with oval ear cups instead.,266
2656,These are great for any  music of mine!,266
2657,I will continue to purchase these headphones whenever they wear out!,266
2658,I'm 5 foot 8 and I suspect my head is about average size for my height and they fit perfectly.,266
2659,I should of bought this headphones a long time ago .,266
2660,"Once the call ended, the music came right back.",266
2661,There have been other comments about sound quality not the greatest because of being Bluetooth but I think they sound fine.,266
2662,"They're not high end headphones by any means, but they sound great for the price and they don't seem to randomly stop working after 8 months like other low price headphones do.",266
2663,"One instance last week I got up to about 30 or 40 feet before it started to drop out, although there was also a wall separating me and my phone.",266
2664,They've got no high end at all.,266
2665,Might as well get the beats by dr dre they are much better the sound stinks!!!,266
2666,Great for the average ipod music lover or for watching movies on the ipad!!!,266
2667,I let them know what the problem was and they had it fixed w/i 3 days.,266
2668,It does not fit to charge it!,266
2669,These headphones get the job done.,266
2670,I still hate using them.,266
2671,I just wanted to write a quick review because of the sound quality.,266
2672,"For Sony these are good headphones for the price tag, had them for about 6 months they are good sounding they have alright bass but very clean highs.",266
2673,"They either don't fit my ears right, pop out, or short out.",266
2674,"These headphones are not very good with music sources that don't have bass tone controls, -like your basic computer.",266
2675,Rugged and not heavy.,267
2676,Now I am stuck with some useless headphones.,267
2677,These are great for working out and stay snug on your ears.,267
2678,In conclusion great headphones for 15 bucks,267
2679,"Typically, I have my iPhone in my pocket or on the desk I'm sitting at or in the space on the treadmill where you set down your devices.",267
2680,I'm by no means an audiophile.,267
2681,I wanted to experiment with bluetooth headphones and these were a solid but low cost way to try them out.,267
2682,I would recommend it to everyone I meet.,267
2683,I wish that the fit was adjustable.,267
2684,"For me, the big win is going to a microUSB charging port means I no longer have to carry a separate miniUSB charger (obsolete) for my headphones.",267
2685,"I loved these white headphones, they are of good quality and portable.",267
2686,"They were ready to test right out of the box, and connected very easily to my phone and laptop.",267
2687,Main reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is they can feel loose at times if I am doing more intense workouts.,267
2688,"Really Sony, 3 ft?",267
2689,I highly recommend!,267
2690,"Sound is pretty good, but do not buy if you intend to use for workouts.",267
2691,The cord is very thick and can take a decent amount of stress so the wires are undamaged.,267
2692,These probably aren't really good for music.,267
2693,Connected easily to my iPhone and iPad and they block out most of the outside noise.,267
2694,"They don't like the earbuds and all the other (besides ""BEATS"") headphones kept falling apart.",267
2695,"However, they are not comfortable for children or people who have slightly smaller heads.",267
2696,I am very satisfied and encourage you to buy this headset.,267
2697,"I use these at work every day while I program, and I have no complaints.",267
2698,"The headphones are light, featuring a nice, thick cable.",267
2699,"I originally bought them to wear at the gym, and they work exceptionally well for that.",267
2700,Only complaint - and it's a minor one - is that they pinch my glasses into my head behind the ears and it's kind of uncomfortable.,268
2701,There is a slight delay with the sound.,268
2702,The design is great.,268
2703,"I just needed an affordable headphone for listening on mi IPhone and iPad,this works and was cheaper then stores near me.",268
2704,"Not deep, but decent.",268
2705,"SO because of that, I am reordering another of the same pair now in April 2016.",268
2706,"Otherwise, it's a solid pair for the price!",268
2707,Calling them something you would give to someone you don't see often.,268
2708,I find them very comfortable and the white on white color scheme is very sharp.,268
2709,I discovered that the sound quality was noticeably poor if bearable.,268
2710,"Come on people, they are not comparable Bose or Beats but for a good pair of knock around headphones, theses are good to go.",268
2711,"Really Sony, 3 ft?",268
2712,They swivel so that it can lay 'flat' but do not 'fold' up into a tidy little bundle as do my Wonderful Air-Fi's (I'm spoiled).,268
2713,I have bought Bluetooth headphones before and they were always poor sounding when bass kicked in.,268
2714,The privacy of knowing that my TV viewing is not disturbing anyone.,268
2715,"After a few hours of use, the drivers sound quality much improved]

I am using them with a Samsung Galaxy S4 and had no trouble connecting them, my first Bluetooth experience.",268
2716,Took a few tries before I could turn off the item well.,268
2717,"However they are definitely the best cheapest headphones I have ever used, and I will be buying the updated model from Sony.",268
2718,Battery last for me about 9 hours on full charge while at work listening to music for that entire time.,268
2719,I would recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of headphones for a good price even if he/she is not using them for running or other activities.,268
2720,"The sound quality is some of the best I have experienced with headphones under $20, you can get a fair bit of bass and easily enough volume to block out the noise around you without blowing out your ears.",268
2721,"For the price, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.",268
2722,"Everyone is quick to bash on Skullcandy, but in my case at least, my $35 Skullcandy's are far superior to these $15 Sony's.",268
2723,The headphone's sound is clear and flat in the mid range and part of the high frequency range.,268
2724,"I'll have to continue using my older headphones over these, but I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.",268
2725,so if you are looking for good audio that won't dent your wallet you can always count on these sony headphone to deliver.,269
2726,But then again what can you expect for $30 bucks.,269
2727,"If you listen to music that isn't bass intensive or you don't really care about getting much bass, get these.",269
2728,"I thought it was just me, but both my brother and my mother had the same problem as well.",269
2729,"The only reason I am giving one start less is, I want to know how much battery life is still remaining in the headset, which I can't see.",269
2730,A co-worker just bought a set for herself.,269
2731,I think that for the average person who listens to pop or rock will  get the right kick out of these.,269
2732,Buying another set for a friend.,269
2733,I use my headphones for listening to class lectures and writing notes.,269
2734,I highly recommend them.,269
2735,They are Perfect!,269
2736,"These wouldn't pair with my Girlfriend's iPhone or iPad, My iPhone or iPad.",269
2737,"It drives me crazy whenever it's visible to me, so I can imagine how annoying it must be for people around me.",269
2738,"impressive range and sound...paired, worked easily out of the box.",269
2739,"I was looking for some wireless headphones but wasn't sure about the sound quality they could have, this headphones are great!",269
2740,"Clear, high quality sound and sturdy construction.",269
2741,"What's more, you can't watch video with them unless you're okay with the audio and video not being synchronized.",269
2742,I really like these!,269
2743,Just the quality Sony put into these $20 headphones!,269
2744,"I've tried downloading various drivers per the advice of Kinivo's tech support (who were NOT very helpful, rushed through our conversation) and nothing works.",269
2745,We could go through about 8 of these in a year and still not hit the prices of one pair of Beats!,269
2746,Ripped it apart and installed in some better headphones.,269
2747,This is actually the second pair of these that I've purchased.,269
2748,I'm not an audiophile.,269
2749,In case your wondering in those three years the sound is the same (This time I bough the Black Colored Version) so there is no downgrade in the quality that at times happens.,269
2750,I think I paid around $20 for these headphones and they are excellent!!,270
2751,"Taking into consideration the price I bought it for, $15, it is by far one of the best for its price range.",270
2752,Pro- It works fine.,270
2753,Highly recommend to those who have budget around 15-20 bucks.,270
2754,They are perfect for my needs.,270
2755,"For the price, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.",270
2756,When their parents tell me that their kids lost or broke their $200 dollar headphones I just smile.,270
2757,Maybe it's because I wear glasses.,270
2758,"Good soun quality for simple video, music and talk hands free.",270
2759,Which is why I need to purchase a new pair annually,270
2760,I tried running with it but it just didn't work out for me since it wasn't as snug as a fit as I had wanted.,270
2761,"I purchased these headphones to use at our home computer for listening to videos, cds, and u-tube.",270
2762,Exactly as pictured.,270
2763,When these break I will buy another pair.,270
2764,I did have a small problem.,270
2765,Worth the money.,270
2766,Best investment ever!,270
2767,The cushions are comfy and the wires are strong.,270
2768,I cut the sleeve down the side to see the plug area and it had it's wires sticking out of the hole in it's side.,270
2769,"I'm not an audio nerd, so my review is just based on an average user who distinguishes headphones by ""it sounds good"" or ""it doesnt sound too great.""",270
2770,"For $15 not bad, but most of these reviews are very deceiving.",270
2771,"The reason being, is because after a while, the plastic starts to hurt the top of your head if they are not correctly fitted to your head.",270
2772,"The sound quality is good (not perfect, but still), and they don't break easily.",270
2773,"when they arrived, at first look I was worried about the non-adjustability of these because,as a female, my head is kinda small, but they fit OK.",270
2774,"I've only used them for a day, but so far they are making a good impression.",270
2775,So far I really like them.,271
2776,Unfortunately i have gone through 2 pairs of these and both no longer work within 2-3 months of using them 5-6 days a week.,271
2777,Oh mey gerd...I ordered a pair of headphones and guess what I got?!,271
2778,They work great for the children in eliminating background noises & listening to their teachers.,271
2779,Sound quality was moderate.,271
2780,"What's even worse is that when the battery gets low, these will emit a series of loud beeps in your ears that signal the battery is about to die.",271
2781,The earbuds are heavily padded and soft as well.,271
2782,An hour or so and that's all I can take.,271
2783,I have purchased two sets of these for my daughter.,271
2784,They are great for using at home when you just want to relax and listen to your favorite jams.,271
2785,"With that out of the way, I think they are a better value then what I paid.",271
2786,I wouldn't waste my money on these due to the poor design.,271
2787,This item was delivered promptly and as agreed on.,271
2788,"I do clean them every so often, so I don't know if it's just that they are dirty and making my skin itch, or if I am having an allergic reaction to the material.",271
2789,"I don't care much about audio quality beyond a certain level of competence, but have gone through dozens of headphone models, and these are decent on that count, certainly better than your typical earbuds.",271
2790,They do take a bit of getting use to getting them on your ears.,271
2791,I've only given them a 4 star because I've only had them for 2 weeks :) we'll see how things go in the months to come :),271
2792,These headphones were recommended to me by a colleague.,271
2793,The head phones worked great for 5 months and then one side of the headphone s broke and you can't hear anything on the left side but other than that they are pretty good,271
2794,I've bought three generations of these headphones.,271
2795,It came with everything the back had listed on it and the jack was wrapped perfectly which gave me the impression that they weren't even plugged in.,271
2796,I've had mine for over 6 months and I haven't had a single problem!,271
2797,They stay in place while doing any excersise from pullups to situps.,271
2798,"I've just been using them for a couple of days so far, but I am very pleased.",271
2799,"By the way, good sound for the price, and they're comfy on the hearing catchers.",271
2800,The flap is useless and always sticking out making the BTH240 unappealing.,272
2801,We have 3 pairs of these in our house as everyone kept stealing mine.,272
2802,"These are lightweight, don't crush my head, decent sound and the cord is just the right length.",272
2803,The volume and skip track buttons give off a loud click when depressed; that click is amplified right next to the ear.,272
2804,"Where the Sony's fit the average human head perfectly and securely, the Kinivo's dig into your skull and start hurting after wearing them any longer than a few minutes.",272
2805,"I have an older version of these headphones at home that still work well, but wanted another set for work.",272
2806,These are my first ever Bluetooth headphones.,272
2807,I like this much better.,272
2808,Within a couple hours my ears are really hurting.,272
2809,These Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones are good.,272
2810,The sounds is ok but not good/very good or excellent.,272
2811,I'd recommend these to anyone looking to get high quality without breaking the bank.,272
2812,I am using them with my Nexus 5 and Macbook to listen to music.,272
2813,Arrived earlier than expected.,272
2814,The new headset paired immediately with my phone and tablet.,272
2815,"After a lot of comparison and online soul searching, Kinivo was my choice, as far as price, sound, and comfort it gets 5 stars.",272
2816,My daughter loves them.,272
2817,"If a phone call comes in, it auto-switches to answer it.",272
2818,They have rich deep bass and incredibly clear treble!,272
2819,This is still great after a year.,272
2820,but they cannot be comfortably worn around the neck as these can.,272
2821,"Stylish, cheap, and sounds really good.",272
2822,Overall it's a good product.,272
2823,If you are looking for audiophile quality why are you buying $20 headphones??????????,272
2824,I have seen amazing reviews of this product on amazon and that's why I ordered it.,272
2825,I've had a pair of these and used them every single day for the past 4 years at work.,273
2826,"and as much as I love Amazon, I don't love over paying if I don't have too.",273
2827,"Once in a while, they'd nip one of my hairs in the joints.",273
2828,"Sound quality is very good for $14 and shipping was prompt with Amazon Prime

Great buy for casual listening",273
2829,I have medium sized ears and they hang off.,273
2830,This is my second pair the first worked great and I loved it.,273
2831,This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I bought 'em because of price and the good ratings.,273
2832,For the price these are a great buy.,273
2833,"Once i put them on, the sound was vivid and very clear.",273
2834,Got for my boys for Christmas.,273
2835,These are great quality for such a low price.,273
2836,"Since these headphones are placed on the back of neck, it is hard to tell you whether they are going to fit you.",273
2837,"They are adjustable, they look great, fit great.",273
2838,Normally cheap headphones are tinny and junky sounding but these really sound good.,273
2839,Could be me but I don't find myself to be technologically illiterate and I completed normal troubleshooting procedure.,273
2840,Loose the wires!,273
2841,My only complaint... No padding on the headband does start to hurt the top of my head but I will like just glue a strip of phone to the underside and call it good.,273
2842,"back on they go...she is disabled so i,m glad to have  something of good quality that she gets so much joy from,  and at a reasonable price,  thanks again.",273
2843,"Even worse, it's terribly uncomfortable to wear.",273
2844,Great headphones.,273
2845,"I think that it was designed for a no longer satisfaction, i don't want buying another one, i'm afraid i lost my money.",273
2846,Now the right one is starting to go out as well.,273
2847,I purchased one set each for my boys to go with their tablets.,273
2848,I do not recommend for adults.,273
2849,"Someone suggested buying a pair of headphones instead of IEM's, and I was in a target one day ruiing the loss of my earbuds and bought these.",273
2850,"However, after bumping my first song on it, I immediately felt 100% satisfied with my purchase.",274
2851,They bluetooth well and do just what they say.,274
2852,Not suitable for running at all.,274
2853,"Kinivo has it's game on, and they even sent me an email immediately asking if I received on time and how were they working.",274
2854,"I wanted to see how low impedance headphones would work with this amplifier, whether I would hear any hiss or hum with such low impedance headphones, and the amplifier passed with flying colors.",274
2855,Perfect for every day use as well as recording.,274
2856,"I felt they were very comfortable as well, lightweight etc.",274
2857,"The audio quality, however, was more akin to the $3 headphones that you get on an airplane to watch a movie, and those headphones are meant to be disposable.",274
2858,"If you really care about studio type clarity, you need to at least $100 to your budget price point and look elsewhere.",274
2859,I bought this for my 14-year-old.,274
2860,Great value and performance.,274
2861,I can leave my phone on the kitchen counter and still stay connected in the basement or upstairs.,274
2862,"I've just been using them for a couple of days so far, but I am very pleased.",274
2863,It's pretty darn gross.,274
2864,"These sound great, and as such make for an incredible value.",274
2865,These aren't anything special.,274
2866,"However, it is comfortable to wear over the head, can be adjusted, has cushion for the ears, and the sound quality is actually very good.",274
2867,He is very picky about his electronics.,274
2868,"When my daughter saw it the first time, she wants it because it matches with her Sony Laptop and now I had to order another one because I need one.",274
2869,"This was purchased to go with a pocket voice recorder, and has decent frequency response for voice recordings.",274
2870,love also because they are comfortable.,274
2871,"However, under Ubuntu the microphone does not work, even when HSP profile is selected.",274
2872,Low battery chime that rings every 40-60 seconds until unit is charged.,274
2873,i walk around w/o iphone in my hand in the house and it still sound great.,274
2874,A really great buy!,274
2875,"I don't know what people are talking about, those who rate it like 1 or 2 stars.",275
2876,These headphones are a pleasant surprise.,275
2877,"All I can say they are better than the more expensive phones I bought elsewhere on line that were called the deal of the day
Update: thin material on the foam earphones flakes off little by little leaving white speckles on your ears.",275
2878,You'll get distortion at about 80% on your iDevice.,275
2879,They only broke when I accidentialy had them in my pocket while kayaking.,275
2880,"I haven't tried running with these on, but I doubt they'd move at all.",275
2881,"Good range, love not being tethered to my phone, and can still listen to my music from two rooms away.",275
2882,"It was reasonably comfortable and the sound was surprisingly good, but the volume was uneven, the left side was noticeably quieter than the right.",275
2883,I am so pleased with this product and have already recommended it to several people!!!,275
2884,"I was looking for a BT Headset without a boom mic, similar to my Motorola S305 which is incredibly quirky with Win7.",275
2885,"I try 2wk s ago and love it but the draw back is the stereo sound quality, kind a not so loud to hear the music in a noisy work place.",275
2886,These are also very sturdy.,275
2887,This is a terrible headphone!!!,275
2888,They fit nicely on the head and the cushion sits fine after wearing them for long periods of time.,275
2889,The 240's i'm dissappointed with.,275
2890,It doesn't matter where - they are simply great!,275
2891,"They are very light weight, they fold for easy carrying in the bag that was provided and the sound is excellent.",275
2892,Overall solid headphones nd great value for the price.,275
2893,I will recommend it to anybody who like me has a constraint budget.,275
2894,"Plus, if I lost it, I could find it by outputting music to it.",275
2895,I was nervous about the volume being too low since everyone was talking about noise cancelation type stuff but I use them and can't hear a thing besides my music and that's all I could ask for!!,275
2896,"It doesn't like the below temps, but it seems like it doesn't affect it... yet.",275
2897,"I've tried downloading various drivers per the advice of Kinivo's tech support (who were NOT very helpful, rushed through our conversation) and nothing works.",275
2898,"The reason I don't score higher is this: cord does not separate from headphones, so if it goes, you have to replace all.",275
2899,I've bought Sony earbuds for about $10 that sound alot better and dynamic than these headphones.,275
2900,(Did I even spell bear right?,276
2901,I cannot stand wearing earbuds because they constantly fall out and they make my ears sore.,276
2902,"My husband ordered them for me, and I won't wear them.",276
2903,I need head phones to listen to my ipod.,276
2904,"The speaker began to crackle in my left ear (it sounded as if it was max volume out of that ear, while the right ear was working normally at the set volume).",276
2905,I should have known to go with Sony in the first place.,276
2906,I recommend these to all people,276
2907,"The audio quality is good, especially considering the fact that they only cost $20 on average.",276
2908,It remembers the last 5 devices you paired with so once I have paired with all of my devices it will be a piece of cake to pair.,276
2909,He loves these headphones and takes them to the gym with him because he likes to listen to music or talk on the phone without having to worry about a cord.,276
2910,"Now I will say that these are my first pair of headphones, but from what I can tell the are really grate!",276
2911,"Also, I wear hearing aids and these work fine with them.",276
2912,I have these in white and they are very good for what I need them.,276
2913,I use my headphones for listening to class lectures and writing notes.,276
2914,"everything is perfect except for the soft fabric inside, on top of the speakers.",276
2915,They are definitely not tight around the head/ear but kind of feels like it's hanging down from my ear.,276
2916,This is still great after a year.,276
2917,I get great signal in the room I lift in and even a few rooms over through walls.,276
2918,They are on fashion here in Ecuador and my daughters love them.,276
2919,"Got them for my 9,13, and 14 year old nephews for christmas.",276
2920,"Again, they're pretty cheap material, but they can hold their own.",276
2921,"Please do yourself a favor and grab a pair of these, you won't regret it.",276
2922,but i figure thats a given with the behind the ear.,276
2923,Love these headphones especially since they weren't too expensive.,276
2924,Sounds good but the fit is little tight for my head.,276
2925,I wanted something that would fold for transport and not have to sacrifice good sound quality.,277
2926,My daughter uses these with her studio equipment.,277
2927,"If your going to buy these take care of them, if you don't then it will definitely break.",277
2928,Loud enough to hear over the mower and long enough to last a work day.,277
2929,While these were cheap they also felt like it.,277
2930,"The more I try using other pairs of headphones or earbuds, the more I appreciate just how good these Sony headphones are.",277
2931,"With such a short cord, the MDR-ZX100's are pretty much only suited for use with an mp3 player that you carry on you, or maybe with a computer desktop where the computer is directly in front of you (with the audio jacks up front).",277
2932,"I have never owned a ""behind the neck"" set of headphones.",277
2933,I now have a Sony professional series for $99 which is amazing compared to this $15.,277
2934,They are Perfect!,277
2935,"I didn't hear the noise while doing the eliptical machine at the club, only when running outside.",277
2936,"I tried the jaybird bluebuds x, and the backbeat fits, both good headphones.",277
2937,Sony tends to always make good headphones with quality sound.,277
2938,"By the way, the sound quality is very nice.",277
2939,This is a great pair of headphones.,277
2940,I was mad but when I put on the head phones I was very happy!,277
2941,Fit well on my head.,277
2942,I'm listening to them now and they have very good sound with good base.,277
2943,Build quality is nice as well; sturdy plastic.,277
2944,"If value and quantity are important considerations, you won't go wrong here.",277
2945,"But I knew i needed to upgrade eventually, I mean I can't sit here using a cell phone earpiece as my main set of earbuds, that's ghetto.",277
2946,"Ask them what Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) or steady-state RMS power or MP3 compression is, and usually that's the end of the conversation.",277
2947,and the sound is EXCELLENT!!!,277
2948,"It's certainly adequate, but impossible to describe as loud.",277
2949,so we got another 2 pairs one for each kid and in different colors.,277
2950,"I liked the first one while it worked, then ordered two more when the first set stopped working suddenly.",278
2951,The fit is not quite as comfortable as some I've tried.,278
2952,It's not a big difference -- it took several back-and-forths to pin it down --  but it is noticeable.,278
2953,"They might be good for children, or as a spare pair, but I wouldn't recommend them for your primary set of headphones.",278
2954,All in all I couldn't be happier and for the price it's a no brainer.,278
2955,I got this in white for my girlfriend and she really loves them.,278
2956,If I move my head up or down it moves the earpieces.,278
2957,"Plus, I'm not super picky about anything as long as I can hear my music clearly and enjoy it.",278
2958,Great headphones for what I need them for and for the price.,278
2959,So I bought a pair for my wife.,278
2960,When their parents tell me that their kids lost or broke their $200 dollar headphones I just smile.,278
2961,The transaction was smooth and the shipping was fast!,278
2962,He thought he'd never find one like it.,278
2963,Also syncing took a great deal of attempts and time to work.,278
2964,Not sure if the issue is rough use or manufacturing.,278
2965,However the ear piece is really soft so that balance out the tight grip.,278
2966,"The ones I had were actually Sony, and more expensive than these headphones!!!!",278
2967,"Compared to the MDR-V100s that I was trying to replace after a speaker went out, this is complete garbage.",278
2968,Bought some Sony wireless headphones for Christmas this year.,278
2969,Am very happy with this purchase.,278
2970,Exactly as pictured.,278
2971,The last time I bought a pair of nice Sony headphones they cost about $60 for the same quality.,278
2972,They look like they belong with the iphone super good looking and solid Sony quality.,278
2973,I sent them back.,278
2974,"The ear cushions are small and barely covers my ears, and I have small ears.",278
2975,I will never buy this or anything similar to it again!,279
2976,I have purchased these headphones twice and I am 100 percent sure that I will not buy another pair of over the head headphones from another company.,279
2977,He loves these headphones and takes them to the gym with him because he likes to listen to music or talk on the phone without having to worry about a cord.,279
2978,"These sound great, and as such make for an incredible value.",279
2979,I now feel like I have either an oversized head or ears.,279
2980,They are very light and compact as well.,279
2981,They definitely stick out and I caught quite a few people taking a second glance at me.,279
2982,I gave these a try based upon the good reviews.,279
2983,The first problem I noticed is the sound quality.,279
2984,Main reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is they can feel loose at times if I am doing more intense workouts.,279
2985,Purchased these based on other reviews three weeks ago.,279
2986,As a result music lacks clarity that you'll find in higher quality headphones.,279
2987,I bought these for use on an airplane to shut out external sounds a bit.,279
2988,They get fairly loud and Don't distort at high volume.,279
2989,"They don't bother your ears at all, and they sound great.",279
2990,This is my recommendation.,279
2991,They have good clear sound reproduction as well they adjust all the way down to fit a smaller child's head with no problem.,279
2992,2) The headphones don't fit very snug.,279
2993,Cons: the plastic that goes around the ear and behind the head is hard and does not flex.,279
2994,Item shipped and was delivered quickly.,279
2995,Thinkin about ordering another pair for home.,279
2996,These have a really good sound for the price.,279
2997,I'm just reviewing so the average Joe can know that these headphones are worth the $15 and that it is a great purchace.,279
2998,Sound quality is acceptable for avarage not demandable user.,279
2999,These are great by any standard.,279
3000,"We went through countless ear buds and headsets, most would last a week if we were lucky.",280
3001,So that means they still need to improve the microphones on the stereo headsets.,280
3002,"Everything else is great, pairs easily, buttons work well, functions as advertised.",280
3003,The sound is spectacular!,280
3004,I recieved the headphones very quickly...,280
3005,I would like to know if any recalls are available for this item!,280
3006,Earpieces fold flat for stowing in a backpack.,280
3007,"A small thing, but worth noting?",280
3008,I expected better from Sony.,280
3009,Even worse with glasses.,280
3010,"And yet, my 4+ year old pair, with cushions that are completely worn out, are really great, and very comfortable to wear!",280
3011,"The good, the bad, and the ugly:
Good- great ergonomic design, very nice feeling on the ears.",280
3012,"With these, I get the full surround on my ears, no headaches from the plastic connection, the cord a good length, and the sound is excellent.",280
3013,I only read the negative reviews so I could find out the quirks that most users found with them.,280
3014,There was some disconnection when using this outside while shooting hoops.,280
3015,"Only trouble is, the white gets dirty very easily.",280
3016,You def can hear a wide range of sounds.,280
3017,I just picked up the SONY MDR-ZX100 headphones today and for the small amount I paid I can't believe the big sound I am getting with them.,280
3018,"The first set I use with my computer in the office, the second I use with my tablet at home so I can watch Netflix while my wife is watching television.",280
3019,"I like them, so I will probably continue to use them, but i wish they were more comfortable.",280
3020,Headphones arrived after long shipping timw with faulty wire.,280
3021,These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've owned.,280
3022,I find the slimmer BTH240 is more attractive and offers controls that are more user-friendly.,280
3023,"Works fine, but not satisfied with quality.",280
3024,The box of the earphone was opened a bit but they did mention that may happen but they arrived safe and sound.,280
3025,I have them on now as I write this review.,281
3026,Once I heard them I ordered another pair to keep at work.,281
3027,"Cons:
Don't get too loud
Bass is nothing compared to my cheaper, in-ear buds.",281
3028,I purchased the LG tone pro afterward and was diss appointed because they were twice as expensive and half the quality.,281
3029,"Please, do not blame the messenger.",281
3030,Simple headphones...they make the gym session go by faster...the blue part of the headphones are obviously cheap plastic not matted like the images....good headphones overall.,281
3031,The battery would not hold a charge after just 1 month of usage.,281
3032,They are also as it stated on arrival-refurbished.,281
3033,"A few days later, they responded letting me know that they were sending a whole new set of headphones and that they should be arriving quickly.",281
3034,I also wanted to buy something very cheap so I don't need to worry about losing it or getting it stolen.,281
3035,Nice little headphones.,281
3036,I bought it for my granddaughter.,281
3037,(Which is more than I can say for may other brands.),281
3038,Thinner would be better.,281
3039,Bought these for my 8yr old son to use on his ipad so i don't have to listen to his games/music in the car.,281
3040,Extremely affordable for the average worker who just wants to listen to music at work or at home.,281
3041,1 star for the product.,281
3042,Really Love it Rather Spend 20$ for decent headphones like these than 200$ or more for beats!,281
3043,Will see how it holds up long term.,281
3044,If that could get fixed I'd love these.,281
3045,"I am changing the volume on the device, but it isn't in the perfect spot it was earlier.",281
3046,1) There is a loss of sound separation in the mid-ranges.,281
3047,These are still working for me.,281
3048,If only my unit delivered on the praise that all of the others held it up to be.,281
3049,Unfortunately they will stop holding a charge after a month or so of everyday use.,281
3050,I would have liked if there was a slight gap or more of a curve.,282
3051,These are nice but they don't fit that great for me.,282
3052,"For 5 dollars more, the Sony MDR-V150 headphones are WAY better.",282
3053,They work perfect and we have no problem.,282
3054,They cannot safely be tossed into the bottom a backpack.,282
3055,"Like I said, I've only used it once, but the one time it was awesome.",282
3056,I gave these a try based upon the good reviews.,282
3057,I loved my BTH220s.,282
3058,I love having buttons on the side so I don't need to be next to my phone.,282
3059,But I'll need to take anger management classes if I keep them myself.,282
3060,Finally figured out that they hook over your ears besides going behind your neck.,282
3061,Wouldn't recommend to anyone hoping for quality with a low price tag.,282
3062,But these are wonders.,282
3063,LIGHT TO HOLD AS WELL.,282
3064,I got these for my daughter's 12th birthday and she loves them.,282
3065,The cord is around 4 ft. in length but it is not bulky.,282
3066,"they are good, minimize external sound, very comfortable and easy on the ears.",282
3067,Music fidelity and bass sounds better than previous wired headsets.,282
3068,"So I suppose I need to order another one, if I can find a color other than blue, red or black that's not hot pink (not my choice of a color, thanks!)",282
3069,Arrived earlier than expected.,282
3070,"It's kind of a PITA, as I leave the headphones at work and I have to re-pair first thing in the morning, after every meeting, when I return from lunch, etc.",282
3071,I bought these because I like to keep up with fashion and ear buds don't stay in my ears.,282
3072,Beats are overrated in my opinion and the quality that Sony offers is top notch and these headphones are a reflection of that.,282
3073,Battery life is amazing!!,282
3074,"Despite the sound and price, I don't recommend these headphones, due mostly on the design issues.",282
3075,"- Portability, the BTH240's fold up nicely and slip into the included cloth bag easily.",283
3076,Simple headphones...they make the gym session go by faster...the blue part of the headphones are obviously cheap plastic not matted like the images....good headphones overall.,283
3077,"A few days later, they responded letting me know that they were sending a whole new set of headphones and that they should be arriving quickly.",283
3078,"The sound cuts a bit if you're moving around a lot, I wore then as I mowed my lawn, but for the most part, 'they're okay.",283
3079,She says they work great and she loves the quality of the sound.,283
3080,"Yes, I would recommend this product.",283
3081,"For less than 20 dollars, SONY is SONY.",283
3082,"I got two pairs, one for a friend in black and the white ones for me, he said that he really likes them because they sound very clear and have good bass.",283
3083,"I love, love, LOVE these headphones!",283
3084,"Read the description before you buy it then get it then complain about it not being noise canceling, these weren't made to cancel out noise, just slightly muffle them out.",283
3085,I thought I missed charging this completely.,283
3086,The cord is around 4 ft. in length but it is not bulky.,283
3087,I was very impressed.,283
3088,As far as the Phone quality.,283
3089,"Good sound, comfortable and perfect for the gym or riding my bike.",283
3090,I will say that they are comfortable but as for connectivity it's not so good.,283
3091,"They've been great for making phone calls, I almost never make a call with just my phone anymore, the sound always come through clearer on the headphones.",283
3092,All in all I highly recommend.,283
3093,"The ear cushions are small and barely covers my ears, and I have small ears.",283
3094,Even just walking around the neighborhood is OK as they cut back on traffic noise.,283
3095,My son wanted these so he got them.,283
3096,These have held up for months without issue.,283
3097,I purchased several different brands of headphones for my 5 year old to use at computer class at school but they kept breaking.,283
3098,"The only real downside is the cord length is short, which I knew about in advance - not an issue for me because I keep my pc on the desk where it should be.",283
3099,They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these).,283
3100,I'm returning them and will investigate if it was just a manufacturing issue.,284
3101,Music is full and clear.,284
3102,The short synopsis is these items work fantastic!!!,284
3103,I did have a small problem.,284
3104,Sound quallity is not great unless eq'd - too little bass and treble.,284
3105,It has been AGES since I ordered these and they still work!,284
3106,"However, I don't like exercising with it.",284
3107,We could hardly hear it.,284
3108,I should have known to go with Sony in the first place.,284
3109,"As for colors: I mainly don't care, but there is some small utility value in having different colors, to make it easier to keep track of which is charged or which belongs in my gymbag.",284
3110,It's too bad because they sound very good IMO.,284
3111,Just want I needed.,284
3112,I got what I payed for.,284
3113,Great price for these headphones.,284
3114,You just can't complain at this price.,284
3115,"These Sony headphones, while not fancy, certainly fit the bill.",284
3116,I've had this for about 3 weeks now and I freaking love it!,284
3117,Don't fall off durning workout or jog.,284
3118,Not perfect but what do you want for 30 bucks.,284
3119,I really look forward to the times when there isn't a lot of background noise and I get to put these on.,284
3120,The wire is excellent.,284
3121,They work pretty good.,284
3122,i was considering for weeks getting some dre beats headphones for my workouts but for 200 dollars they better come with a mobile personal DJ.. gave these a try and am very happy with the sound and comfort and saving $175 for the holidays,284
3123,I am sure this is a good headset but not for what I needed it for.,284
3124,"Pros:
Stylish look
Comfortable to wear
Deliver's satisfactory sound quality.",284
3125,"They're also lightly made, so I won't be surprised if the padding wears out or something snaps, but for this price they're easily replaced.",285
3126,I do not like those earbud style headsets.,285
3127,They can get pretty loud.,285
3128,Been wearing them since.,285
3129,"The only downside is the lack of microphone, and fact that they don't fold up as nicely as other pairs.",285
3130,I bought them for around $20 and it was honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made.,285
3131,I listen to Rap/Hip-hop and Metal/core/screamo style music.,285
3132,Be careful handling them until you figure how they unfold out and fold up... as they're fragile compared to Sony MDR700V's.,285
3133,I am sure it would work fine if I wanted music playing on it the entire time.,285
3134,I don't recommend these,285
3135,Plenty loud enough for most users and insanely long battery life.,285
3136,The ear pads were ok for a short time but also became uncomfortable after extended periods of use.,285
3137,I haven't tried it in a noise area for phone conversations.,285
3138,"They are not what I expected, but they're great for the price.",285
3139,"Outside sounds, like sounds of shrieking children while you're wearing headphones, seemed to be amplified to a piercing sound to me.",285
3140,And they are so much cheaper!,285
3141,Use them mostly for listening to music.,285
3142,Another thing I noticed is that they aren't really loud.,285
3143,Enter Kinivo BTH (behind the head I assume?).,285
3144,"They are comfortable, adjusts easily and i thought they were very affordable.",285
3145,"When sitting down and my phone resting on the table, I've never experienced any inconsistencies.",285
3146,"I don't personally have any complaints because for the price, they are very good sounding headphones.",285
3147,Good quality and the great design help at a good price helped me enjoy them and use them as frequently as possible.,285
3148,It brings an extra breath of life to any song that's playing.,285
3149,The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because they drop calls - even when you have a wifi assisted connection.,285
3150,It has a good level of keeping outside noises out but not to the extent where you can't hear anything.,286
3151,I find the ear piece to be very comfortable.,286
3152,I paid $12 for these and they are great.,286
3153,"Im the kind of person that only uses earbuds but i got this because of the low price and how they look....But OMG when they came i was so happy,they work great,they are awesome!",286
3154,They also get a little loose occasionally and the screws need to be tightened once in a while (especially if you fold them up regularly).,286
3155,I just picked up the SONY MDR-ZX100 headphones today and for the small amount I paid I can't believe the big sound I am getting with them.,286
3156,I bought some headphones thinking they had Base either than that there good headphones but no Base :( I would recommend this for who ever like headphones with Low Base :),286
3157,"They pair easily, rarely skip even for a second and have a very decent range (25-30 feet).",286
3158,SO these are comfortable.,286
3159,Spend the extra 10-20 to get some sturdy headphones with padding.,286
3160,"Easy to set up with Android Bluetooth, long battery life, fits well.",286
3161,I let a friend borrow those so decided to get a second pair.,286
3162,They sound better than competing headphones in the under $50 range.,286
3163,I wasn't expecting a whole lot for $25 so I am pleasantly surprised.,286
3164,"But, with the price set on this level!",286
3165,"However, the time has come to replace them.",286
3166,"2) When used longer, it tends to get really warm in your ears.",286
3167,It needs charging probably once or twice a week with regular use.,286
3168,The range isn't too bad either.,286
3169,The volume and skip track buttons give off a loud click when depressed; that click is amplified right next to the ear.,286
3170,use them every day.,286
3171,I guess you get what you pay for.,286
3172,"I listen to different kinds of music, pop, rap, instrumental, Polynesian, classical, etc.",286
3173,"Now it's better than new because the cable is longer,  and better quality than the flimsy cable it came with.",286
3174,They fit well on the ears.,286
3175,It's so damn uncomfortable.,287
3176,The first problem I noticed is the sound quality.,287
3177,"Don't expect to get the best pair of headphones ever, but I've found that they're probably worth at least 30 or 35 dollars.",287
3178,The price was right so I figured I would give them a try.,287
3179,They also stay put.,287
3180,Affordable too!,287
3181,They are great for running or other exercise.,287
3182,Microphone works well and can even be used with Siri.,287
3183,My guess is that the batteries started to wear.,287
3184,The sound quality is biased towards the bass side of neutral which is not my preference - but we are discussing $14.00 phones!,287
3185,So let's just say they could be more comfortable when your head is lying on a pillow.,287
3186,I got this for an 2nd Gen Ipod Touch that has a problem with using the Amazon Basic keyboard (even though it's Blutooth).,287
3187,"Up until last night, I was really kind of bragging about how great the second set had been.",287
3188,The other person could not hear me.,287
3189,I also use these headphones when I'm on the computer; I've watched a few interviews online and it's interesting what background noises these headphones pick up.,287
3190,Would order from again.,287
3191,"In fact, these exact ones.",287
3192,It was a great purchase.,287
3193,"So far, the overall operations are working well and this is a very nice headset for the price.",287
3194,"Now I will say that these are my first pair of headphones, but from what I can tell the are really grate!",287
3195,I've only given them a 4 star because I've only had them for 2 weeks :) we'll see how things go in the months to come :),287
3196,These aren't really either.,287
3197,"Beats, but they aren't bad quality at all.",287
3198,I'm using it right now and have been the last 4 hours... still no feed me beep and I still haven't charged it....it's awesome.,287
3199,one word amazing!!,287
3200,Bought these for my wife.,288
3201,These headsets are awesome.,288
3202,We got these headphones for our hard-of-hearing members of the congregation.,288
3203,Even worse with glasses.,288
3204,I'm going to be replacing these headphones in a matter of days so I thought I'd give them a review.,288
3205,Here's a hint: EQ them.,288
3206,"Fortunately, someone at Motorola must have foreseen this and engineered these rings that snap off of the earphone, allowing you to wrap the foam over them, and clip them right back on; amazingly increasing longevity.",288
3207,Am very happy with this purchase.,288
3208,"The 10 hour battery life isn't a big deal, as I only use them for listening to music at work, and I charge them overnight.",288
3209,I don't think they are made to be waterproof.,288
3210,I'm not interested in making phone calls with those headphones.,288
3211,"These headphone look stylish, contour to my head well, and sound great!!",288
3212,Overall it is a good product that I use on a daily basis!,288
3213,"They never break on the band, so they are sturdy...though I do take great care with my headphones as much as possible.",288
3214,I bought some headphones thinking they had Base either than that there good headphones but no Base :( I would recommend this for who ever like headphones with Low Base :),288
3215,The bass is disappointing by being barely audible and sounding muffled and unclear.,288
3216,"Well, these dont... they're smaller than they look... they sit ON your ear, not OVER it.",288
3217,I love these headphones.,288
3218,So far very happy with them.,288
3219,This wasn't a bad sound--if you like blues and jazz this set would be good with that warm sound.,288
3220,Excellent value!,288
3221,"Also, nobody mentionned it, a (very) short limited warrantly of 90 days is provided.",288
3222,These are some kind of thin synthetic leather-like material with foam inside.,288
3223,"Sound:
  Just bought a pair because I left my Alessandro MS-1s at home and am listenning now.",288
3224,The sound is good and acceptable.,288
3225,These headphones are bulky and weigh almost twice as much as the S305's.,289
3226,Two best features are the exceptional sound quality and very long battery life.,289
3227,Used them for about 3+ hours today while on the stationary bike and they didn't feel uncomfortable even after.,289
3228,Be careful handling them until you figure how they unfold out and fold up... as they're fragile compared to Sony MDR700V's.,289
3229,I used these mainly for going to the gym.,289
3230,Now if you're expecting a high end sterophile experience then look elsewhere.,289
3231,"For most people, they'll sound great for just $15, especially if your device/program has an adjustable EQ.",289
3232,It brings an extra breath of life to any song that's playing.,289
3233,"I told him i had got these Sony headphones your tablet, when plugged the headphones into his tablet  only 1 speaker would sound  (the left side only).",289
3234,He's loves them.,289
3235,"They are very comfortable and also look nice in the white, I use these more than my iPhone 5 earbuds now.",289
3236,You don't have to go through that process every time.,289
3237,"sorry, slamming this with a one start because it takes a month to ship and no heads up on the description.",289
3238,The sound comes out clearly and they stay on pretty well as i jog.,289
3239,"For a Dark Side of the Moon session, you'll want better.",289
3240,"Sound quality is very good for $14 and shipping was prompt with Amazon Prime

Great buy for casual listening",289
3241,I looked at several different makes and models and decided to try these.,289
3242,She can wear them for hours while she studies without trouble.,289
3243,"The other set still function and work as expected, but extended high volume finally took its toll on the speakers.",289
3244,Well the headphones weren't picking up on the sound when I was using it with any program on the PC.,289
3245,Only alternative was to send them back.,289
3246,"Other reviews on the newer 240 mentioned that the bar is closer to the head, so I thought this problem with the 220 would be lessened.",289
3247,Mine lasts 1 year (I used it when running.,289
3248,All ambient noise will leak in and all noises created by the headphones will leak out.,289
3249,"Typically less than a second, but occasionally stretches longer for short periods.",289
3250,"So far i used to watch movies, video studying in the middle of the night without waking my roommate.",290
3251,There is no warning anywhere that you shouldn't use it for more intense workouts.,290
3252,"They have a decent bass sound but it is lacking in that deep rumble, however it does sound very good.",290
3253,The band is worn in the back of the neck so it's out of the way and you forget they are even there!,290
3254,after first workout they of course got sweaty and to my shock the cushion for ear came off.,290
3255,I had those same ones in white and they lasted 3 years of very heavy child use.,290
3256,They also work well for those long trips in the car when he would like to listen to his own music or watch a show on the DVD player.,290
3257,"They fit securely but comfortably around the ears, and I haven't experienced any issue with them wanting to come off during workouts.",290
3258,I tried to like these.,290
3259,I would not buy again.,290
3260,"UPDATE: After a couple years of being dropped, stepped on, and listened to, these still work.",290
3261,I was look for an adjustment to decrease or increase the length of the neck band.,290
3262,I would recommend byting this with such price.,290
3263,- Fit my head well (size 7 5/8 hat) and stayed in place while active.,290
3264,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,290
3265,If not for the jack being as pictured I would have given this product 5 stars.,290
3266,"I was a little concerned when I found these headphones on Amazon because they had such great reviews and tons of them, at a great price, but I had never heard of the brand, nor had any of my friends, but I couldn't pass them up.",290
3267,That will be the only negative I could find with these headphones.,290
3268,"- I don't care how cheap it is, if your product is not really noise canceling, do not advertise it as such.",290
3269,"While I viewed them as a holdover until I could afford something higher-end like the Jaybirds Bluebuds X, I may end up putting off that decision longer than I anticipated!",290
3270,I am seriously amazed at how good these sound.,290
3271,Over a month later and it's still there.,290
3272,I got what I payed for.,290
3273,I highly recommend these to anyone!,290
3274,"The cord is pretty nice, it is thick and sturdy.",290
3275,This is actually my second Sony MDRZX100 headphones.,291
3276,"Again, they're pretty cheap material, but they can hold their own.",291
3277,"But anyway, SO worth $20.",291
3278,Replaced another pair which did not hold a charge for more than two hours.,291
3279,If anyone would find these painful it would be me.,291
3280,They give a really nice sound experience INMHO especially for being fairly inexpensive headphones.,291
3281,Got for my boys for Christmas.,291
3282,"everything is perfect except for the soft fabric inside, on top of the speakers.",291
3283,Drowns out the crazies on my morning bus commute.,291
3284,I ordered these to use strictly at my computer because I wanted the household noise to be blocked out.,291
3285,They deliver very good sound with this receiver.,291
3286,"when they arrived, at first look I was worried about the non-adjustability of these because,as a female, my head is kinda small, but they fit OK.",291
3287,The only negative thing I can say about the headphones at this time has to do with the rubber piece covering the charging plug.,291
3288,I bought these headphones because I needed something for my digital media class and I didn't want to spend a fortune.,291
3289,"Anyway I was looking for the dj style that covers the ears and provide at least some noise reduction, for under 20 doll-hairs.",291
3290,Pretty good for the price - just interface quirks.,291
3291,I now feel like I have either an oversized head or ears.,291
3292,"not much power under the hood coming from an ipod touch 4, and it isn't comfortable like anything you spend big bucks for.",291
3293,When they did work they did a decent job for the price but always had a rattling in the right ear and didn't block out much noise.,291
3294,He loves them and we are extremely happy.,291
3295,I like them so much!!,291
3296,Cord is really short - come on Sony!,291
3297,I just got them today and they are not bad at all; good sound output and good looking.,291
3298,"They were ready to test right out of the box, and connected very easily to my phone and laptop.",291
3299,"Plastic head strap seems sturdy enough, but it's day one.",291
3300,The only thing I miss in these headphones is padding on top.,292
3301,"Comfortable, and sound quality is decent enough you don't hate life.",292
3302,I sweat too dam much and these have held up pretty good.,292
3303,I've used them regularly for several months now and am still pleased with the quality.,292
3304,Just no comparison in my opinion.,292
3305,"yes for the price as many said, these are real nice but bottom line is the clarity wasn't close to even my flimsy apple airbuds so these are going back for that reason.",292
3306,These headphones are a godsend.,292
3307,I was worried about the sound quality but there is bass and everything seems well balanced.,292
3308,"TIP:
If you want the ear pads to last longer, make sure you wipe the natural oils from your ears before using them - every time.",292
3309,Received product within 5 days and was well packaged for delivery.,292
3310,"For Sony these are good headphones for the price tag, had them for about 6 months they are good sounding they have alright bass but very clean highs.",292
3311,I've had other headphones like these in the past but I didn't expect anything more for cheap headphones.,292
3312,I just wish they included a carrying case so i could just throw it in my backpack.,292
3313,"Got these a long time ago, still kicking.",292
3314,I'm not sure exactly how far it is ... maybe 60-75 feet or so ... far enough to be able to get a drink or go grab some equipment without having to move my phone.,292
3315,"I have bought a hundred or hundreds...  of items on Amazon going back to when it was just books... these are very close to the best value for the money that I have ever purchased, period, not just on Amazon.",292
3316,I use these for connecting to a home receiver for watching movies to keep from upsetting sleeping family.,292
3317,They got me on my feet when i first started recording music,292
3318,Not sure if this is a wake up call or a warning or something.,292
3319,"Gave these as a gift to a friend and received positive feedback as the headphones did not give her a headache as others do (did not squeeze her head as tightly, and fit perfectly).",292
3320,I will never buy this or anything similar to it again!,292
3321,These headphones are comfortable enough that I can have them on for hours without experiencing any discomfort.,292
3322,"When sitting down and my phone resting on the table, I've never experienced any inconsistencies.",292
3323,Enter Kinivo BTH (behind the head I assume?).,292
3324,They stay on your head very well when you go running.,292
3325,"I'll be one of the dissenters who says they sound good, but not as good as the MDR-V150s they replaced.",293
3326,I just gave that headset to my son when he went to college and bought the BHT240.,293
3327,"Overall, I'm a happy customer.",293
3328,It came with everything the back had listed on it and the jack was wrapped perfectly which gave me the impression that they weren't even plugged in.,293
3329,"Easy to use, light (in spite of their size), these headphones are really perfect.",293
3330,"Typically, I wear them while walking or taking public transportation, so no real advantage for me.",293
3331,"Because kids are using them, I don't want to spend a lot, but I want them to hold up a little while.",293
3332,"Though I did receive comments on the receiving end that it was a bit soft, and with Skype Echo testing it sounded fine to me (although a bit flat, but I am not planning on using this mic for any karaoke).",293
3333,These headphones are great.,293
3334,They stick out a lot and make you look funny.,293
3335,I am really hoping that the plastic band will stretch a little over time to make them looser.,293
3336,I don't wear it for long periods of time cause it get uncomfortable.,293
3337,"I run, so I hate those little earbuds because they always fall out and they irritate my ear.",293
3338,I have used these headphones on several runs and in the gym a few times now and I must say that I am quite impressed.,293
3339,We use the new set for audio and phone calls only.,293
3340,Seem to eliminate background noise somewhat as well as people can still understand me when I'm out walking around my plant.,293
3341,They really work.,293
3342,For the price i paid i was actually not expecting the quality that came out of the speaker.,293
3343,They stay put once adjusted.,293
3344,The bass is weak and oppressed.,293
3345,Use them to work out at the gym.,293
3346,As I expected of a Sony product and more.,293
3347,On Windows 8 it can be very difficult to figure out if you have bluetooth and how to turn it on.,293
3348,"It's fake leather, so little black flecks of fabric will start to appear on your ears as they break apart.",293
3349,"Except that it's not for people with small head, it is a great product for casual listening",293
3350,Great for working around the house.,294
3351,"I have not done a phone call with this, so I cannot attest to how well you'd sound on the other end and vice versa.",294
3352,Small children I have.,294
3353,The price was nice ($25) they arrived the next day and I started using them immediately.,294
3354,Highly recommend to those who have budget around 15-20 bucks.,294
3355,Every so often they start to cut out even if my phone is in my hand or nearby.,294
3356,The speaker is basically just smaller so it moves less air.,294
3357,They sit comfortably on my head and I like the little red bar which identifies the right side.,294
3358,I love their sound quality.,294
3359,I have not had to charge them yet!,294
3360,I choose the Sony's because I have enough familiarity with Sony headphones to know that they are very clean.,294
3361,"With those few cons in mind, they produced admirable sound quality, paired easily and never lost connection with my phone, and most importantly don't have cords and stayed on my ears!",294
3362,My only complaint is with the fit.,294
3363,I don't wear them for more than a couple hours.,294
3364,"If you have prominent ridges on your ears and normal head phones bother you, don't buy these because it will be just as bad if not worse.",294
3365,These will be my second set of this model Sony headphone.,294
3366,I emailed the manufacturer about 3 weeks ago and no response.,294
3367,"I don't know how they even justified the largest setting, as no one must have a head that large
-These are NOT circumaural.",294
3368,Even after sweat they work great.,294
3369,"That, combined with a great many calls where the headset abruptly dropped connectivity with a loud ""PANG!""",294
3370,"I usually don't take the time to review things, but this product is an exception I feel that these headphone comparing them to beats on display at the store are almost better.",294
3371,"He loved the design and thought the sound was good, but this past week it stopped working.",294
3372,Would definitely recommend them!,294
3373,"they are good, minimize external sound, very comfortable and easy on the ears.",294
3374,"The reason being, is because after a while, the plastic starts to hurt the top of your head if they are not correctly fitted to your head.",294
3375,The battery life is great and easily lasts a full 8 hour day at work.,295
3376,"Look, you are getting what you are paying.",295
3377,I needed some new headphones when the old ones died.,295
3378,You can't see that in the picture.,295
3379,"To my surprise, they sounded pretty good for $15.",295
3380,"It's not the most comfortable experience if you wear glasses, and it makes leaning your head back uncomfortable.",295
3381,"I've had them for over 6 months now, and they've continued to work exceptionally well.",295
3382,Awesome BT headphones for a reasonable price.,295
3383,I think these things will cause wear over time and cause these sort of issues.,295
3384,It keeps my ears warms as a plus.,295
3385,"Pros:
-Well built
-Good price

Cons:
-Wire randomly twists after normal use

the wires twist into themselves after using them for only a few days.",295
3386,"I based my purchasing decisions largely on other reviews, which led to believe that the sound quality was better than it actually is..",295
3387,For me it was very loose even with it clinging on my ears.,295
3388,First off let me say I did not give this 5 stars because of its hi fidelity sound.,295
3389,"All in all a wonderful product, at an amazing price.",295
3390,That may be the headphones or it may be the cellular signal where I'm at or where the listener is at.,295
3391,"But for quick easy portable, these are pretty good to be honest.",295
3392,We bought these for use on the computer with our 8 year old.,295
3393,Price comparable to lesser models seen at Wal-Mart and the like.,295
3394,Probably not ideal for kids but it still works.,295
3395,"The sound these headphones deliver, for a quarter of the price of my Grados, is fantastic.",295
3396,They are great and he loves them.,295
3397,"All in all it is worth buying I recommend doing so for music,phone calls, and Skype or other online chat.",295
3398,"Respectable sound quality,  Decent base and mid-levels.",295
3399,"I use them mostly in the gym, and signal is strong.",295
3400,I do understand that these are on ear headphones with small drivers.,296
3401,I have forgotten a few times and it lasted an additional week.,296
3402,Highly recommend.,296
3403,"I was looking for some wireless headphones but wasn't sure about the sound quality they could have, this headphones are great!",296
3404,So let's just say they could be more comfortable when your head is lying on a pillow.,296
3405,"I use them with an iPhone, and setup/pairing was quick and easy.",296
3406,I wouldn't recommend these.,296
3407,"Cons:
1. when walking the outside noise can be loader than the headset.",296
3408,"There is some getting used to the controls- volume, pause, bluetooth, etc.",296
3409,Perhaps this product is not designed to be paired with more than one item at a time.,296
3410,Somewhat comfy.,296
3411,"Also the headband isn't padded, it's just plastic.",296
3412,"But, with the price set on this level!",296
3413,I'd wonder if someone with normal or large ears might have some trouble with the size of the ear pieces.,296
3414,Would recommend them to anyone.,296
3415,"I've had them for over 6 months now, and they've continued to work exceptionally well.",296
3416,Nothing sounds distorted or shrill.,296
3417,I've had other headphones like these in the past but I didn't expect anything more for cheap headphones.,296
3418,They feel cheap but you what you pay for.,296
3419,"I don't like ear buds, so wearing only over the ear headphones is the only way I can enjoy private audio experiences.",296
3420,Once I heard them I ordered another pair to keep at work.,296
3421,A really decent pair of headphones at a budget-minded price.,296
3422,"I use them with an iPhone, and setup/pairing was quick and easy.",296
3423,Still worth the price though!,296
3424,Comfortable and they stay on my head very well.,296
3425,"I'd recommend KOSS Titanium cheapo's instead.. for the same basic price range they are lighter, sound much better and are more comfortable, plus have volume slider... they just don't have the full enclosure for blocking other sounds as much.",297
3426,Then I accidentally snapped them in half lol because I thought they were fold able ( completely my fault; just know that they aren't fold able).,297
3427,and they also look awesome when i work out!,297
3428,Occasionally I unknowingly hit the button and start a phone call.,297
3429,Will be getting a lighter pair next.,297
3430,"Overall, good sound quality, good price, decently durable and comfortable to the ears.",297
3431,A nice purchase.,297
3432,"After all they've been through, they are still working in perfect condition.",297
3433,"I have 4 pair just lying around the house, so that when someone wants to use them, they can.",297
3434,I use these all the time at the gym and while doing things around the house while talking to people or listening to music or podcasts.,297
3435,"However, under Ubuntu the microphone does not work, even when HSP profile is selected.",297
3436,"Please, do not blame the messenger.",297
3437,My daughter is using them with her iPad and is very happy.,297
3438,The sound quality is much better than the ipad ear buds I had been using.,297
3439,I use these daily and love them!,297
3440,It's actually big enough for regular people.,297
3441,"After initially pairing to your computer, all you have to do is turn the device on and it will connect automatically.",297
3442,I listen to music most of the time at work and I can't constantly fiddle with these and get things done.,297
3443,I bought this headset to use with my Samsung Tablet.,297
3444,Only alternative was to send them back.,297
3445,Sound Quality (4 stars): Sound quality is enjoyable.,297
3446,"The 10 hour battery life isn't a big deal, as I only use them for listening to music at work, and I charge them overnight.",297
3447,I was also very surprised at how comfortable they are.,297
3448,"I have tried multiple phones and eventually they all disconnect for a moment depending on whether the phone is upside down, or which pocket I have the phone in.",297
3449,"In terms of sound, I'd say that they are about the same quality.",297
3450,They sat for another 6 months until I got around to fixing them.,298
3451,Folks that ask me about them are amazed at the low price point in comparison to other models.,298
3452,The distance you can go is pretty good.,298
3453,Comfy headphones that do not bother me after prolonged usage.,298
3454,Guess I'll never know that though.,298
3455,"At first I thought this was perhaps my wifi as I was streaming music, but subsequently I tried with music stored locally on my phone and had the same results, so it appears it is indeed the bluetooth connection.",298
3456,I bought it almost one year ago and have been wearing them to gym and outdoor cycling.,298
3457,"Couple of other folks have them, and they all gave me positive reviews which influenced my purchase even more.",298
3458,The Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone exceeded my expectations.,298
3459,The biggest difference between these and the old V 150's is that those were very dark and even more veiled sounding.,298
3460,Love the fact that they are very stylish and look more expensive that the retail price however the sound it's too low I have to turn up all the volume in order to have a nice sound,298
3461,I have has the for 5 whole days now.,298
3462,I think that for the average person who listens to pop or rock will  get the right kick out of these.,298
3463,Very comfortable too.,298
3464,"I plan on using this primarily while doing yard work and mowing, so its more liable to get dirty.",298
3465,Easily heard by people around you.,298
3466,We could go through about 8 of these in a year and still not hit the prices of one pair of Beats!,298
3467,"They are very comfortable and they are Sony, a name brand.",298
3468,I'm not concerned about them falling off.,298
3469,I was skeptical with what the quality would be like considering the low price.,298
3470,Usually I'm lucky if they last 6 months.,298
3471,"It could be made comfortable if it were adjustable, but it isn't.",298
3472,"I've owned a lot of wired headphones, some of which were hi end.",298
3473,"So I sleep in these things, I stand up forgetting their on and yank the cord hard.. it gets stepped on sat on twisted... water all over them.",298
3474,"Thank God he doesn't know what ""Dre Beats"" are.",298
3475,These are just the ticket.,299
3476,"It's kind of a PITA, as I leave the headphones at work and I have to re-pair first thing in the morning, after every meeting, when I return from lunch, etc.",299
3477,"For the price these are the best wireless headphones I have ever found, the battery lasts for weeks, the sound quality is good, and the on headphone volume and song scroll controls are quite responsive.",299
3478,"""They work"" is about all I can say about these headphones.",299
3479,I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them like beats etc.,299
3480,"yes for the price as many said, these are real nice but bottom line is the clarity wasn't close to even my flimsy apple airbuds so these are going back for that reason.",299
3481,(The working part of the aids are outside the ear.),299
3482,The are a little small (I have a big head) but the fit.,299
3483,I rarely use it.,299
3484,Shocked at the Sony quality.,299
3485,The cord is long enough for me.,299
3486,The first one was for my child's schools needs.,299
3487,The price was right so I figured I would give them a try.,299
3488,I had these for a while till  bought some Skullcandy headphones and I gave these to my brother.,299
3489,The kids use these with their tablets to watch movies in the car and leave me alone.,299
3490,My daughter is using them with her iPad and is very happy.,299
3491,So after eliminating issues with the devices it only leave the headphones.,299
3492,Be careful handling them until you figure how they unfold out and fold up... as they're fragile compared to Sony MDR700V's.,299
3493,"I thought these were going to be good quality sound, but their worst then walmart $5 headphones.",299
3494,Like I don't even need to know that dude.,299
3495,I bought these for use on an airplane to shut out external sounds a bit.,299
3496,No problems at all.,299
3497,The service from the vendor was excellent.,299
3498,What I don't like is the sense that it lacks a little oomph.,299
3499,I needed a cheap pair of head phones that I was hoping would give decent sound.,299
3500,I have a pair of white ones that are running 2 years strong right now!,300
3501,Overalls great set if having chords is really not possible for you,300
3502,"For the price, the headphones are awesome!",300
3503,I have apple head phones from 2 years ago and I kick the crap out of them and still no damage and no drop in performance.,300
3504,"Even when I'm not trying to fiddle with them, my left ear canal is slightly bigger than my right and almost all ear buds end up sliding out or moving out of place, even with earhooks.",300
3505,these are at a great price and work great i think i may buy another pair.. the only thing that takes a little getting use to is the behind the neck idea.. but other than that they have a great sound quality and an even greater price....,300
3506,"If you live by yourself or will be using these in a quiet room, they should be fine.",300
3507,"I based my purchasing decisions largely on other reviews, which led to believe that the sound quality was better than it actually is..",300
3508,"I have, some years ago, bought these headphones and they have held up well, I will probably buy them again one day.",300
3509,Will update this review to let you know what I think.,300
3510,I should of bought this headphones a long time ago .,300
3511,Which is why I need to purchase a new pair annually,300
3512,"However noises in front of me overpower my voice, possibly due to the microphone hole facing forward?",300
3513,My teenage son uses them constantly and hasn't had any problems.,300

3520,One thing to be aware of when turning off the power to the headset.,300
3521,I'd recommend these to anyone looking to get high quality without breaking the bank.,300
3522,I've been using them for more then a month and so far so good!,300
3523,"Love the no cord aspect, fits great has wonderful sound quality.",300
3524,Would buy again.,300

3526,"There is sound when plugged into my phone, but even with adapters purchased at a local electronic store, I have not been able to get them to work with my computer or TV.",301
3527,i complain alot about how the headphones i buy are too cheap and don't really work.,301
3528,I could not hear announcements but could hear enough to know they were making one.,301
3529,Which is why I need to purchase a new pair annually,301
3530,They are totally worth it and if your worried about them not looking pretty they are very stylish.,301
3531,Its easy to conceal since it sits comfortably over the ears and behind the neck and under my hair.,301
3532,"A great value, too.",301
3533,"Hold charge for a long time, no issue in pairing and has good range also.",301
3534,"The headphones themselves are hard to keep attached to the ears, at least mine, falling off frequently with light movement.",301
3535,Pros - They are made for traveling.,301
3536,Not too shabby for the price dynamic range 8 out of 10 depends on the output of you're system at my age 40+ hendrix and clapton always sound like gods.,301
3537,I don't know why this product has so many good reviews.,301
3538,Came quickly and works well!,301
3539,"It drives me crazy whenever it's visible to me, so I can imagine how annoying it must be for people around me.",301
3540,"They certainly do not compare to Bose in sound quality or comfort, but for the price, the sound quality is quite good and they appear to be reasonably durable.",301
3541,Took a few tries before I could turn off the item well.,301
3542,Its a decent product but not what i was looking for.,301
3543,"Deep bass, yet not too overpowering.",301
3544,I could only hear through one side.,301
3545,Cord is decent as it should be but top is very cheap plastic.,301
3546,"If you want bumping phenomenal bass, go pay $300.00 for a pair of Bose headphones.",301
3547,"Compared to the MDR-V100s that I was trying to replace after a speaker went out, this is complete garbage.",301
3548,"They made it all the way to Friday afternoon again... My previous headphones would last two days and crashed & burned permanently after a hard workout...
Definitely will buy again if the ones I have ever fail!!",301
3549,The sound is not that great but it matches many of 30 dlls headphones,301
3550,"However, for me, it's really minimal.",302
3551,Bought these for my daughter to use with a portable DVD player.,302
3552,Sony's MDR-ZX100's are amazing.,302
3553,For $30 you cannot complain though.,302
3554,"Have only had these a few days but initial impressions are ""pretty"" good.",302
3555,I will be returning them.,302

3560,"Boosts the bass volume compared to my macbook, but not too heavy that it's bothersome in my ears.",302
3561,"I use them as my everyday ones now, and they are very comfortable.",302
3562,"I mean, I am talking after a couple hours it starts getting a little annoying with the plastic pressing on the top of your head.",302
3563,These are perfect for the price.,302
3564,After a lot of research I decided to try these.,302
3565,I'd recommend these for anyone looking for a solid pair of bluetooth headphones thats always on the go.,302
3566,Paired right away with no issues.,302
3567,They have met all my expectations...,302
3568,They needed charging & so I charged it to full battery & they worked for an hour after turning them on & faded out.,302
3569,Gift for my wife as she had been using some pretty crude earphones to listen to music from her laptop.,302

3571,"Have only had these a few days but initial impressions are ""pretty"" good.",302
3572,"I wish they were smaller, and I'd like a version that goes over the top of the head (instead of over the back).",302
3573,Just pay attention to the short instructions and this headset could not be easier to connect (Windows 8.1).,302
3574,She can wear them for hours while she studies without trouble.,302
3575,He listens to a lot of classic rock so the 1st song he listened to was Kashmir by Led Zeppelin and he said it sounded phenomenal!,303
3576,When they did work they did a decent job for the price but always had a rattling in the right ear and didn't block out much noise.,303
3577,"The sound quality is more improved than the original, and while these headphones do not isolate the user from his or her surroundings, the audio quality is still very crisp and clear.",303
3578,Simple headphones...they make the gym session go by faster...the blue part of the headphones are obviously cheap plastic not matted like the images....good headphones overall.,303
3579,They were and they sent me a pair as well.,303
3580,I will continue to use my $5 Koss headphones I got at Walmart.,303
3581,"As I was saying, these headphones are fantastic because they are very light weight and good quality.",303

3595,I have no complaints about it and use it every day.,303
3596,So I am a regular gym goer and I use my headphone while working out.,303
3597,"But these are all small issues in my opinion, definitely not showstoppers.",303
3598,Not the highest quality materials so they may be easy to break if your careless with them.long battery life.,303
3599,also the controls are easy to access.,303
3600,"Good for music and calls , do not recommend for work outs, they fit behind the head and have a tendency to fall off .",304

3606,Unfortunately they will stop holding a charge after a month or so of everyday use.,304
3607,I love good bass and these guys deliver without being overpowering.,304
3608,One extra star because of the reasonable price.,304
3609,I've had these over a year I think and I have not experienced a short in either cord despite my 4 y.o.,304
3610,Definitely recommend!,304
3611,"If you need a step up from earbuds but do they want to spend more money on a sound proof one, this is the one to buy.",304
3612,The sound-quality when wearing them is clear and even works with bass-heavy* songs.,304
3613,I'm not sure if I'm crazy or not but it makes sense as the right ear is the one with all the controls.,304
3614,He's loves them.,304
3615,I was very impressed.,304
3616,Battery last for me about 9 hours on full charge while at work listening to music for that entire time.,304
3617,"That being said, I needed these for listening to lectures and classes online and didn't want to put much money into it.",304
3618,But then again what can you expect for $30 bucks.,304
3619,Perfect for every day use as well as recording.,304
3620,He is very picky about his electronics.,304
3621,It's OK if you're not very picky about the sound of your music.,304
3622,I am really hoping that the plastic band will stretch a little over time to make them looser.,304
3623,It came on time as well.,304
3624,I'm a big guy with a big head and neck BUT I had hoped the designers had factored that into their design specs.,304
3625,Very good stereo sound.,305
3626,The pink color is a little flatter and not as bright as you would think.,305
3627,"i was discussed with the sound quality of these headphones, Sony dropped the ball on these.",305
3628,The sound is good enough for general listening.,305
3629,if you are in the market for an inexpensive bluetooth headset these are for you.,305
3630,The transaction was smooth and the shipping was fast!,305
3631,"I like the slim form factor, and voice prompts mean I don't have to speak ""beep beep"" to understand what my headset is telling me.",305
3632,They only broke when I accidentialy had them in my pocket while kayaking.,305
3633,I would recommend them highly based on my usage so far.,305
3634,"The good, the bad, and the ugly:
Good- great ergonomic design, very nice feeling on the ears.",305
3635,The cord is fairly large so it doesn't get tangled and it very durable.,305
3636,The sound is very clear and the bass is very defined.,305
3637,"Secondly, the ear cups don't swivel nearly as much as the older ones did, which makes it difficult to place them on your head.",305
3638,I let them know what the problem was and they had it fixed w/i 3 days.,305
3639,They work excellent!,305
3640,"Plus, a friend of mine called while I was running so it had clear sound and she was able to hear me clearly.",305
3641,They do take a bit of getting use to getting them on your ears.,305
3642,"I am not a professional dj, and nor is my daughter;)",305
3643,You won't find this quality for that cheap at your local Wal-Mart.,305
3644,I do wear glasses but have had no problem with other headphones.,305
3645,Overall I wouldnt recommend this product and wish I had bought something else.,305
3646,The only reason they get a 4 is because of the slight rattle of the buttons and time I had to spend getting them to my comfort level.,305
3647,The price is certainly right.,305
3648,Its easy to conceal since it sits comfortably over the ears and behind the neck and under my hair.,305
3649,I did not get comfort.,305
3650,These are terribly uncomfortable.,306
3651,Don't waste your money on such a cheap piece of crap.,306
3652,I either take them off or shift them so that they're hanging on the top part of my ear instead of the part of my ear connected to my head.,306
3653,"If a phone call comes in, it auto-switches to answer it.",306
3654,I prefer my in-ear jawbones for outside of gym.,306
3655,I noticed when I put my hand over the side with the controls it really interferes with the connection.,306
3656,This headset is equal to a much higher priced set.,306
3657,I bought my first pair of these in 2013.,306
3658,My kids love them.,306
3659,Every so often they start to cut out even if my phone is in my hand or nearby.,306
3660,"When they came in the mail, he was thrilled.",306
3661,These headphones were a waste of money!!!!,306
3662,I now feel like I have either an oversized head or ears.,306
3663,I love these headphones.,306
3664,"After I head some fancy beats snap, I turned to these.",306
3665,She uses them with her iPod shuffle or watching movies on the computer.,306
3666,"Sony has had their ups and downs over the years (eh hem, PS4...), but at least they are unwilling to license their name to a total piece of junk.",306
3667,I did have a small problem.,306
3668,"I originally bought them to wear at the gym, and they work exceptionally well for that.",306
3669,"Not expensive, but not cheap.",306
3670,This is more subtle.,306
3671,I love good bass and these guys deliver without being overpowering.,306
3672,Do not buy if you have large ears.,306
3673,"If you want fashion, buy beats, if you want function, buy sony.",306
3674,The white is pretty classy in my opinion.,306
3675,"The reason I don't score higher is this: cord does not separate from headphones, so if it goes, you have to replace all.",307
3676,"Easy to wear (not uncomfortable), stay on my ears when i need them to, not much else to say.",307
3677,I will continue to purchase these headphones whenever they wear out!,307
3678,"So I sleep in these things, I stand up forgetting their on and yank the cord hard.. it gets stepped on sat on twisted... water all over them.",307
3679,"I'm partial to over-the-ear headphones, never could get used to uncomfortable earbuds.",307
3680,"Not that I was using them... oh, which brings up another good point!",307
3681,Good quality headphones.,307
3682,"Thank God he doesn't know what ""Dre Beats"" are.",307
3683,He is a big man and they fit his head nicely with the adjustable sides.,307
3684,"For the price, you can't go wrong really.",307
3685,"Also, the - well, I don't know the name for it, but the thing that connects the two ear-phones, can contact the back of my neck when I look up, which also moves the unit a bit.",307
3686,The distance for these is good as well - I have yet to go past their reach.,307
3687,The problem is the things pinch my head.,307
3688,I'm amazed at the stereo separation achieved with a wireless signal.,307
3689,These aren't really either.,307
3690,I love using these when I work out since it allows me to answer phone calls.,307
3691,If you want your moneys worth than your gonna have to spend a little money to get the quality you want.,307
3692,And sometimes they send used products.,307
3693,Love how you can adjust for comfort.,307
3694,"That said, the instructions for all of these tasks were abundantly clear.",307
3695,"The only reason I am giving one start less is, I want to know how much battery life is still remaining in the headset, which I can't see.",307
3696,They have good sound for just listening to music or movies.,307
3697,These are not bad headphones for the price.,307
3698,"Constantly skips, or disconnects and refuses to reconnect to my computer.",307
3699,"The battery life is ok, I just wish it had a longer battery life.",307
3700,"Bought these a few years ago now as my primary pair at work, they're still going strong and do the job.",308
3701,The shipping was fast and product as described.,308
3702,"I honestly got these as a secondary pair, when I don't feel like using or lending anyone my Bose.",308
3703,And by the time I realized this I was out of the return window.,308
3704,"I wouldn't recommend them for DJing or producing, since they do not at all have ""Studio Quality"" sound.",308
3705,Spend a little more and buy something better.,308
3706,I've bought some headphones that pressed against my ears too much and made me uncomfortable and some other headphones that couldn't take a beating and broke down too fast.,308
3707,If you are looking for a great house phone Panasonic makes one with Bluetooth so you can charge your Smartphone and still talk.,308
3708,I would not buy it again.,308
3709,"From my wife's point of view, they are light weight, comfortable on her head, and sound very good.",308
3710,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,308
3711,I have to reconnect it at least 10 times a day.,308
3712,I just didn't take it upon myself to actually see what that size would be.,308
3713,"Lightweight, feels comfortable around ears, and provides above-average sound for the price.",308
3714,"The wife liked them so much for the gym, she had me order her a second set to wear at work.",308
3715,"By the way, the sound quality is very nice.",308
3716,Plugin is a little tight when charging.,308
3717,That didn't help.,308
3718,Then I joined a gym with the MUSIC LOOP FROM HELL.,308
3719,They are totally worth it and if your worried about them not looking pretty they are very stylish.,308
3720,"If you're just looking for decent headphones for occasional use at a reasonable price, these are worth your consideration.",308
3721,"Once i put them on, the sound was vivid and very clear.",308
3722,"While not a Bose or those other HD headphones for the price range, I don't think you'll see much better value.",308
3723,"They gave me a bit of a headache when I first starting using them, but it was so worth it.",308
3724,They are well built and have held up to anything I have put them through.,308
3725,"It's been a while since I bought some over ear headphones... and let me say that I love headphones, and while I love my music, I wouldn't say that I could qualify as a true audiophile.",309
3726,Overall a good pair of headphones for a good price.,309
3727,They just recently died they no longer turn on.,309
3728,"They are low, really low compared to the Sony MDR-V150.",309
3729,I went a whole week using them without having to recharge.,309
3730,Purchased these based on other reviews three weeks ago.,309
3731,This pair must have a short it never stays connected it beeps all day long going in and out.,309
3732,I wanted to experiment with bluetooth headphones and these were a solid but low cost way to try them out.,309
3733,Its a decent product but not what i was looking for.,309
3734,I use them with my smartphone and if I'm watching television or listening to music all I have to do is push a button on the side to answer a call.,309
3735,"Generally, hardware with SONY written on the side of it performs well.",309
3736,"Good for music and calls , do not recommend for work outs, they fit behind the head and have a tendency to fall off .",309
3737,Bought these for my kids in school and I didn't want to spend a lot for school supplies.,309
3738,"As many said in other review,  these headphones are a bit large.",309
3739,I listen to a lot of audio books and love these ear phones for than.,309
3740,"The sound is surprisingly good, the padding is comfortable, and they don't cost much.",309
3741,"For the price I would say these headphones are about what you should expect, but I would highly suggest putting in the extra 10 dollars or so for a higher quality pair.",309
3742,"The sound from these headphones is phenomenal, I love that they're white in color, and they're comfortable on the ears.",309
3743,The bass is just awesome.,309
3744,The headband is way too rigid and totally uncomfortable.,309
3745,I bought this color and the white one for my kids that last longer than other brands.,309
3746,They look great and connect easily.,309
3747,So far so good.,309
3748,They also fit fine with my glasses on without pinching which is something I was worried about.,309
3749,"I doubt they're good enough for a plane, but for a dorm or most bus rides you should be very isolated.",309
3750,Sound is clear and loud.,310
3751,These are fairly terrible.,310
3752,"Maybe these aren't perfectly audiophile but it would be hard to touch this quality without spending a whole, whole lot more.",310
3753,Very impressed with the quality of the product.,310
3754,I need a ponytail in place to hold the headband up so that it doesn't drift down.,310
3755,The only gripe would be the band is stiff and really really wide.,310
3756,The cord is perfect for me but that is because I am short so the cord is not super long for me.,310
3757,"If this isn't a problem, this would be a good choice for  you.",310
3758,I also really like the buttons on the side for adjusting the volume; they're perfect for when you're listening to music away from your computer.,310
3759,"Not too bad for $15-20 and of course not $200 Beats or Bose sounding, but At $20 I also have a pair of Sennheiser HD202s that blow these Sonys out of the water.",310
3760,My only 'con' would be length of the cable.,310
3761,"The battery life is excellent, I've never had the battery run down on me.",310
3762,"Even when I'm not trying to fiddle with them, my left ear canal is slightly bigger than my right and almost all ear buds end up sliding out or moving out of place, even with earhooks.",310
3763,"I chose Sony because the extension connecting the headphones to any device is flexible, thus allowing the headphones to last longer despite.",310
3764,I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them like beats etc.,310
3765,"Although the cord is a little shorter than I would like, it's still slightly longer than the cord on my Apple earbuds they replaced.",310
3766,I've only had the headphones about a week.,310
3767,I think I paid around $20 for these headphones and they are excellent!!,310
3768,I have a wonderful 12 yr old who breaks everything that he touches.,310
3769,"With those few cons in mind, they produced admirable sound quality, paired easily and never lost connection with my phone, and most importantly don't have cords and stayed on my ears!",310
3770,"I'm not sure whether if the sound had to do with the apple products, but both the Sony headphones, and my old generic $10.00  store bought headphones produced the same sound.",310
3771,They don't completely cover your ear but the sound quality is very well put together.,310
3772,They're the best ones I've ever owned.,310
3773,"For the price, I don't think that these 'phones can be beat.",310
3774,"Overall: decent headphones, obviously they're $15 so they're not great, but they do good enough.",310
3775,Not bad for the price.,311
3776,You can wear them for a long time without getting a headache (also note that I have a big head and a lot of hair so this tends to be a problem for me).,311
3777,"I didn't hear the noise while doing the eliptical machine at the club, only when running outside.",311
3778,"You'll be fine listening to rap and hip-hop, but stuff like dubstep, with alot of bass, would sound bad.",311
3779,Amazing Headphone.,311
3780,I listen to Rap/Hip-hop and Metal/core/screamo style music.,311
3781,Good quality sound for a half-decent price.,311
3782,This hurts after a short time.,311
3783,They just won't charge anymore.,311
3784,"I purchased these headphones to be able to listen to music on my iPhone, and take and make phone calls as well as to stream music through either my Mac Book Air or iMac.",311
3785,"Other than that, they're fine.",311
3786,I noticed when I put my hand over the side with the controls it really interferes with the connection.,311
3787,It's no longer so white but that is expected.,311
3788,"One minor irritation is that the back of the headphone, that is, the plastic link between the earpieces, gets in the way, if I am leaning on my sofa or lying down,  If that part could be made thinner and adjustable, it would be a five star product",311
3789,I sweat too dam much and these have held up pretty good.,311
3790,"They are compatible with every music/sound device that I own like my laptop, phone, mp3 player and radio.",311
3791,Efficiency: This just means how loud they go.,311
3792,The charge held for a long time and the sound was decent.,311
3793,I purchased these expecting them to be comfortable and have better than normal sound.,311
3794,"Plastic head strap seems sturdy enough, but it's day one.",311
3795,I needed some new headphones when the old ones died.,311
3796,The range of the headset is amazing.,311
3797,"However, if you can spend a little bit more, I would suggest spending 100-200$ for a much punchier and clearer sound.",311
3798,These are good if you are looking for cheap headphones.,311
3799,"The sound quality is good (not perfect, but still), and they don't break easily.",311
3800,Item is bent out of shape so I cannot even return it.,312
3801,All ambient noise will leak in and all noises created by the headphones will leak out.,312
3802,Save your money and get a different product.,312
3803,They connect super easy to bluetooth and I can walk pretty much all over the house with little to no interruption.,312
3804,This headphone isn't as loud as other competitors.,312
3805,"After poking around the sound properties for this device, I found that it was set to Telephony quality sound format (single channel) with no option to upgrade it to CD or DVD quality (which I thought was pretty much the standard these days).",312
3806,The actual make up of the product is of high quality as well.,312
3807,"I mentioned that I used my TV - on the back it has a headphone out jack and I picked up a ""monoprice bluetooth splitter"" (those are your search words).",312
3808,"Overall these are the best pair of Stereo Bluetooth headphones I've ever used and I've tried Plantronics, Motorola 305's and Sony.",312
3809,"I love balanced clean sound, but I'm also a child of the 80's... so I like bass I can feel.",312
3810,For this price you can't ask for anything better.,312
3811,Pretty good sound.,312
3812,Everthing you liked abou the older version is great accept the newfound bulk.,312
3813,one word amazing!!,312
3814,Would order from again.,312
3815,I don't even wear them anymore and I haven't even had them long because they were so uncomfortable.,312
3816,Finally got the time to use my headphones yesterday.,312
3817,It's been 4 years since i've bought them and they are still going strong!,312
3818,"Also, it seems like it struggles to keep pace intermittently.",312
3819,Luckily the main box was fine and nothing was broken.,312
3820,Paired right away with no issues.,312
3821,I'm sure this plastic would snap if you twisted these too firmly or stepped on them too hard.,312
3822,"I am wearing these headphones right now writing this review, and I am not even listening to music!",312
3823,I can connect even during a call.,312
3824,*Comfortable Secure Fit.,312
3825,These work great.,313
3826,"Best pair of headphones I have ever owned, and for that price they're a steal!",313
3827,"Overview: These Sony Stereo Headphones don't have any sound quality, comfort, or build quality (everything you want in headphones), but they are cheap.",313
3828,I like these headphones.,313
3829,Hope you enjoy them as much as I do!,313
3830,"Only good for small digital devices, which is why I bought them.",313
3831,I'm in love with these things.,313
3832,"I have awkward sized ears, so most in-ear earbuds don't fit me or cause pain when I try to use them.",313
3833,very comfortable.. easily pairs to my Sony Z3V which i love.. and the battery life is amazing..Kinivo did it right with these budget headphones..,313
3834,The cable is a quite a bit shorter than the 7506s.,313
3835,I used this when I was running.,313
3836,I think these were aimed at teens and tweens with smaller heads.,313
3837,These were a great fit.,313
3838,I feel like I got an incredible bargain for the price with this product.,313
3839,They definitely stick out and I caught quite a few people taking a second glance at me.,313
3840,Highly recommend.,313
3841,Just pay attention to the short instructions and this headset could not be easier to connect (Windows 8.1).,313
3842,Folks that ask me about them are amazed at the low price point in comparison to other models.,313
3843,These have a small flashing blue paired light and not even noticeable.,313
3844,And then last month another side of this product didn't fuction well.,313
3845,I wear these at work.,313
3846,"One star less because it is not in same league as those top of the line headsets but as I said, super value for money.",313
3847,These are my first set of bluetooth headphones and most of my use of these is listening to audiobooks on a Samsung Galaxy Note II.,313
3848,"This is my 2nd pair, the sound quality, comfort, and overall feel is just second to none for the very affordable price.",313
3849,"Its now impossible to charge the headset

COMFORT: The ears are nicely padded,but the clips are close fitting and tend to pinch.",313
3850,I would say this is a very nice pair of headphones for the price you are paying for them.,314
3851,"If you put these in a backpack or duffle, be extremely careful.",314
3852,They are very lightweight and fit over my ears well.,314
3853,- They're adjustable.,314
3854,"These are lightweight, don't crush my head, decent sound and the cord is just the right length.",314
3855,"I purchased high end pair, the ear pad connector broke conveniently a week after warranty ran out.",314
3856,if you are in the market for an inexpensive bluetooth headset these are for you.,314
3857,Great item for the price.,314
3858,These are built to last!,314
3859,For the price you can't beat it.,314
3860,I was a bit disappointed I had a pair of the MDRZX100 and wanted another pair since my first messed up.,314
3861,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DESIGNED .,314
3862,"Use for exercise: Stays on while I am walking on a treadmill or elliptical, but not running.",314
3863,Overall I wouldnt recommend this product and wish I had bought something else.,314
3864,For a great price!,314
3865,I use them to work out and have yet to have them fall off regardless how much movement is going around.,314
3866,These came faster than expected!,314
3867,"Overall very satisfied - it's also very cost efficient compared to its competitors, will keep updated as far as wear and tear.",314
3868,"- Very affordable

Cons:
  - No battery indicator, but it starts beeping in your ear when it's getting low.",314
3869,They give a really nice sound experience INMHO especially for being fairly inexpensive headphones.,314
3870,I think when using on a mobile device the quality of the sound is not as good as when you use it on the computer.,314
3871,"After touching and using the product Kinivo, Arctic, Soundbot ranging from $20 - $36 are going to be about the same quality in sound.",314
3872,"When they arrived, with other things that I had ordered, the headphone package was open, the edges of it were all worn and torn.",314
3873,I've purchased three pairs of these for my kids (two pairs in white/pink and one in blue/black).,314
3874,They sit very lightly on my rather large head.,314
3875,Happy with the price point and glad I purchased them.,315
3876,"And yet, my 4+ year old pair, with cushions that are completely worn out, are really great, and very comfortable to wear!",315
3877,I love these headphones!,315
3878,"I bought them to replace my regular earphones, and my first impression was that they are really good.",315
3879,I purchase the BTH240 and the BTD-400 bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter for my Dell laptop which I had recently converted from WIN7 to Ubuntu Linux 14.04.,315
3880,I have always felt like they made a good product for value headphones.,315
3881,"Beats, but they aren't bad quality at all.",315
3882,I run treadmills and rid trains with this and can't care about anyone else's opinion about the brand because they don't know what perfection I'm listening to.,315
3883,The various control buttons operate with a nice firm 'click' and their positions are easily remembered.,315
3884,"For the price I would say these headphones are about what you should expect, but I would highly suggest putting in the extra 10 dollars or so for a higher quality pair.",315
3885,Comfortable and they stay on my head very well.,315
3886,"These are, in my opinion, quite a step up.",315

3896,These headphones are the most uncomfortable I've ever owned.,315
3897,They are very durable and have a nice sound quality.,315
3898,"I basically put these on at 8, and leave them on until 6.",315
3899,I paid $12 for these and they are great.,315
3900,Overall I have to say that I do like the headphones.,316
3901,"They are very light weight, they fold for easy carrying in the bag that was provided and the sound is excellent.",316
3902,"My Bose headphones died after ten years of hard use, so I bought these thinking they would be a good temporary set until I chose a more permanent set.",316
3903,"The volume does not go very loud, and has little to no bass.",316
3904,Good enough for me since i'm not that person who spends $$$ on audio quality...,316
3905,Not the best sound quality but considering the price they are as good as most headphones in the $30-$70 range.,316
3906,Instructions are clearly written and the battery last a long time.,316
3907,"The new Apple earbuds stay in my ears pretty well, but the wire is a hassle during a workout.",316
3908,i think they are better then just basic ear budds.,316
3909,"i don't use headphones alot and wasn't going to spend over $100 for a pair,this pair i like a lot, good sound,not to loud but loud enough,i use it at the gym",316

3911,I think I paid around $20 for these headphones and they are excellent!!,316

3923,Somewhat comfy.,316
3924,They fit really nice.,316
3925,I'll have to try to look for another brand... not sure why they just decided to give?,317
3926,"They don't have intense bass but I don't really go for that anyway, If you're looking for bass I've seen good reviews for the bass on the Sony MDRZX300.",317
3927,I bought the Jabra because they can support 2 devices at one time.,317
3928,Other than being a bit too large I love these headphones.,317
3929,guess i'll be returning these Sony ones and forking up the extra $30 bucks for another pair of Sennheisers.,317

3931,These are my primary headphones doe.,317
3932,I don't know why but I love them!,317
3933,They just won't charge anymore.,317
3934,The Koss PortaPro is still my all-time favorite bargain headphones.,317
3935,"This is more the style of the earphone class, and not particular to this model.",317
3936,"Nope, they're pretty comfortable, and I've rarely found headphone I didn't hate, I have a rather large head and imagine they'd be super comfortable on most people.",317
3937,"I made sure they were well taken care of, but maybe I used them too much.",317
3938,"I mainly use my headphones at the gym, watching videos on the elliptical machine and listening to music while working out.",317
3939,You won't regret it!,317
3940,How do they do it for that price?,317
3941,(dollar store headphones) I could make out much less of the audio than I could with my existing headphones.,317
3942,Bono's voice sounds greater than ever!,317
3943,"If you are just using it for hanbds free the battery will last for days, then recharges in an hour.",317
3944,I wouldn't even consider them as an upgrade from standard ipod earbud quality.,317
3945,Within a couple hours my ears are really hurting.,317
3946,"As far as the Kinivo BTH240s, I read the reviews and the 'tweaks' that were made to improve it made it seem like the perfect match for what I was looking for.",317
3947,I bought mine almost two years ago for twenty bucks and it still works so well.,317
3948,The headphone are not the best in the world or even top of the line.,317

3953,I've looked at all the other Bluetooth headset on here and this one was my number one choice and #1 recommended.,318
3954,"My previous headset, an LG HBS-730 had significant issues in this area, and I'm very happy to say the difference between the two headsets is night and day.",318
3955,I recommend highly that you buy a pair!,318
3956,I've had these over a year I think and I have not experienced a short in either cord despite my 4 y.o.,318
3957,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,318
3958,"In hindsight, I should have stepped up the extra $13 and purchased the Koss R10.",318
3959,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,318
3960,"-Good sound, with good bass.",318

3962,I use my phone for listening to music or audiobooks while driving and watching movies or my droidtv when I'm not.,318
3963,"I purchased these headphones to be able to listen to music on my iPhone, and take and make phone calls as well as to stream music through either my Mac Book Air or iMac.",318

3966,"For instance, the leatherette has not peeled off even though I use it almost daily at the gym.",318
3967,The headphones arrived on time and in good shape.,318
3968,These sound horrible and Sony should make the design engineer wear ribbons of shame.,318
3969,I would buy these again.,318
3970,I have purchased two sets of these for my daughter.,318
3971,Before buying them I was a little hesitant based on reviews from other users on amazon.,318
3972,they last longer than advertised.,318
3973,"Excellent headset for price, very comfortable.",318
3974,The build quality on this pair is much higher however.,318
3975,Highly recommend this product.,319
3976,There was some disconnection when using this outside while shooting hoops.,319
3977,My husband finally tested it and discovered that only the left side worked.,319
3978,"Some of the button functions, such as play/pause, are not instantaneous.",319

3983,Been using it like 6 or 7 hours while I jog and no problem so far.,319
3984,Sound is great!,319
3985,It's bass heavy (which I like) and clear.,319
3986,My old Logitech headphones were way better.,319
3987,"Either that, or I have abnormally large and sensitive ears.",319
3988,"These are really affordable headphones, nice and loud with decent bass.",319
3989,"I'll be one of the dissenters who says they sound good, but not as good as the MDR-V150s they replaced.",319
3990,They sit comfortably on my head and I like the little red bar which identifies the right side.,319
3991,"The battery life is ok, I just wish it had a longer battery life.",319
3992,They are pretty tight on the ears.,319
3993,I've love the way this headset works with my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.,319
3994,I used to be able to wear a hood with the V150s but the ZX100 are much wider and a hood just looks absurd pulled over them.,319
3995,"It presses into the top of your head no matter how you adjust it, which makes watching movies or multiple episodes of a show with them extremely unpleasant.",319
3996,They fold up so nicely and fit in my bag to take anywhere I go.,319
3997,The headphones looked nice but no matter what I tried I could not get sound in both right and left sides.,319

9,"But, with the price set on this level!",320
10,They fit nicely on the head and the cushion sits fine after wearing them for long periods of time.,320

12,"These are nice headphones, delivers in sound both bass and treble, works great with MP3 players (battery drainer) but sounds and looks great.",320

14,The sound is great and the battery life is decent.,320
15,One star only because there's no negative.,320
16,The red light will go on for just a couple of minutes and then go off..,320
17,IF this is product is an indication they are back.,320

30,Pleased with the durability and reasonable price.,321
31,"For the price, the Kinivo BTH240 is very good, comparable to headsets that cost hundreds of dollars.",321
32,"And thats not even the loudest the headphones can go, I have not tried these at full volume, and I don't plan on it, I'd rather not blow the speakers.",321
33,The sound quality is better than about 95% of the other headphones I've ever owned (all were wired).,321
34,They are so convenient for when he is working he can listen to his music and answer phone calls with just one click without having to take out his phone and answer the call or change songs!,321
35,It came with everything the back had listed on it and the jack was wrapped perfectly which gave me the impression that they weren't even plugged in.,321
36,These headphones are nice.,321
37,";) I didn't want to spend a lot on headphones, but I also have some difficulty with headphones making my ears/head hurt (either by poor design or bad acoustics).",321
38,"I revised my review to 4 stars, would be 5 if the microphone worked better.",321
39,"I use them mostly in the gym, and signal is strong.",321
40,You can't see that in the picture.,321
41,"Now, these headphones will not blow you away in terms of audio performance, and this was not the reason that I purchased and/or love them.",321
42,I've used them regularly for several months now and am still pleased with the quality.,321
43,This headset is excellent except for the muffled at times when i talk to someone.,321

47,"The handiness of bluetooth combine with how small and lightweight the item is to create the perfect ""jogger's headphones"".",321
48,"Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.",321
49,I got these headphones in an odd way.,321
50,"With such a short cord, the MDR-ZX100's are pretty much only suited for use with an mp3 player that you carry on you, or maybe with a computer desktop where the computer is directly in front of you (with the audio jacks up front).",322
51,It is not top of the line but you will not go wrong with purchasing it.,322
52,Great distance and battery life.,322
53,"They don't bother your ears at all, and they sound great.",322
54,I have a pair of white ones that are running 2 years strong right now!,322
55,So the new three star rating is for the company not the headset that gets a two tops.,322
56,I doubt I'll need to any time soon.,322
57,"After receiving them timely, putting one set on the shelf, I hooked up the first set.",322
58,i think they are better then just basic ear budds.,322
59,For $30 you cannot complain though.,322
60,"Battery is a small 3.7v 400mAh rectangle battery, almost the same as the ones used in the small quadcopter drones.",322
61,"However, this was likely because of how use to my *awesome* Apple earbuds i was.",322
62,"These work really well (not perfect) with my iPhone 5, MapMyFitness, and my Fitletic Race Belt.",322
63,They are definitely not tight around the head/ear but kind of feels like it's hanging down from my ear.,322
64,After a lot of research I decided to try these.,322
65,"so i can move around my room, untethered, and run to the bathroom or whatever, but i can't set music to play and then wander around the whole house.",322
66,I was looking for decent over-the-ear headphones and found these on Amazon.,322

68,"Started up my music, my music taste runs from soft instrumental to heavily based rap and rock.",322
69,I'm by no means an audiophile.,322
70,"It could be made comfortable if it were adjustable, but it isn't.",322
71,"Good range, good battery life, great price.",322
72,These solve both problems!,322
73,All of the New Music I just down loaded sounded greater than I ever expected.,322
74,"But if you're like me and would rather not spend hundreds of dollars on headphones, these work just fine.",322
75,I'm thinking there is a way to push a button or something to access the phone (Siri) but I have pressed all the buttons and still haven't been successful.,323
76,I use my phone for listening to music or audiobooks while driving and watching movies or my droidtv when I'm not.,323
77,But after 1 day of use I can hear a rattle as if something is loose in the right earpiece after just 1 day of use.,323
78,"I thought they sounded great, I'm sure others are better but these are so cost effective I could buy a pair for less then $30 which is amazing.",323
79,They are exactly like the picture looks.,323
80,"They certainly do not compare to Bose in sound quality or comfort, but for the price, the sound quality is quite good and they appear to be reasonably durable.",323
81,"Yes, I would recommend this product.",323
82,"When you need to block out the background sounds of dorm life or the city while you're doing your own thing, these headphones do a wonderful job with general noise.",323
83,They don't really stay in place for me when I am working out and they do cause some slight discomfort behind the ears for me.,323
84,The problem is the things pinch my head.,323
85,I have forgotten a few times and it lasted an additional week.,323
86,Only and minor complaint is that the plastic band stretches .,323
87,I get great signal in the room I lift in and even a few rooms over through walls.,323
88,Im sure kinovo switched production to have cheaper production costs.,323
89,These are my first set of bluetooth headphones and most of my use of these is listening to audiobooks on a Samsung Galaxy Note II.,323
90,"Also, while it is lightly sitting on ear, it also isolates the noise pretty well.",323
91,I was hoping they would balence out more and give better quality but that never happened.,323
92,"I would have easily paid double for these headphones, and still given them 5 stars.",323
93,"If you are looking for a quality pair of headphones but do not want to spend a fortune, look no further!",323
94,I find the little red indicator that tells which side is the right side very handy and thoughtful too.,323
95,I do not think that I will be buying another pair when (more like if) these die on me.,323
96,Love this headphone that I bought 2 of them.,323
97,"After about 7 years of heavy use, the plastic/vinyl on the ear cups is starting to peel away.",323
98,"Also for my MP3 player, like I said they do drain the batteries kinda fast.",323
99,The white is pretty classy in my opinion.,323
100,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,324
101,"Also the headband isn't padded, it's just plastic.",324
102,They are great.,324
103,I wear a 7.5 hat and these don't fit me well.,324
104,Not clear if you can use a cigarette lighter USB charger in car or truck to supply charging power to the headphone when out and about.,324
105,He's loves them.,324
106,The problem is the things pinch my head.,324
107,The fit isn't quite as snug as I'd like and the headphones tend to move around slightly while jogging.,324
108,"I love, love, LOVE these headphones!",324
109,The quality of sound for songs and movie is ok with me but I am not expert.,324
110,"Since these are on-ear headphones and are not noise cancelling, they do not really keep outside noise out, especially if you're on a plane or around noisy people.",324
111,"Low cost, low quality.",324
112,"For this price, that's fine.",324
113,"Not sure how to resolve that, at least it connects to my phone without issue.",324
114,very comfortable.. easily pairs to my Sony Z3V which i love.. and the battery life is amazing..Kinivo did it right with these budget headphones..,324
115,I wanted something that would fold for transport and not have to sacrifice good sound quality.,324
116,"These are great, inexpensive headphones for watching Netflix from your laptop or tablet.",324
117,These are built to last!,324
118,"As I mentioned, these are not the headphones that you want if you are an audiophile seeking perfect sound, heavy bass response or noise cancelling capabilities.",324
119,Sound is Muffled like it needs more power to drive it?,324
120,Just bought a second pair so my wife can listen to her audio books!,324
121,The transaction was smooth and the shipping was fast!,324
122,"It's got a very powerful transceiver, and will gladly keep you connected across the room from your source.",324
123,I'd give it 5 stars for sound and comfort.,324
124,"My main issue is that they keep cutting out, like multiple times in the length of a single song.",324
125,I bought 2 more after I bought the first one.,325
126,If I wanted something high end I would of paid high end money.,325
127,The speaker is basically just smaller so it moves less air.,325
128,"Design features:

Size - I would call these a ""medium"" zize phone.",325
129,If anyone knows where I can buy a cushion over the top of these please contact me chkaczsn@yahoo.com,325
130,Good quality and the great design help at a good price helped me enjoy them and use them as frequently as possible.,325
131,Then finally the exterior bridge that holds the phones on the bar broke.,325
132,"these are great little headphones, I was expecting them to be bulkier from the other reviews .",325
133,She has multiple sclerosis and has no feeling in her arms and hands.,325
134,Would definitely buy again.,325
135,My main purpose for these are for phone conversations which sound crystal clear.,325
136,"However, the Kinivo BTH240 pair up every time, no matter what device I am connecting them to...and for a $30 device, this is impressive.",325
137,These are great for working out and stay snug on your ears.,325
138,"I tried them also, they sound ok for a budget price set.",325
139,"Good sound, comfortable and perfect for the gym or riding my bike.",325
140,"Even worse, it's terribly uncomfortable to wear.",325
141,Only foolish people with too much money pay more than this for headphones.,325
142,Sometimes you read a review once you already own a product that just rings true.,325
143,"Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.",325
144,I'll definitely be buying these again!!,325
145,But they get the job done.,325
146,They stay on your head very well when you go running.,325
147,The sound quality is much better than the ipad ear buds I had been using.,325
148,"The battery life is ok, I just wish it had a longer battery life.",325
149,"I have dropped them, yanked the cord a few times, though not ridiculously hard...",325
150,The ONLY draw back to these headphones is that if you wear glasses (like I do) it takes some adjusting so that the ear handles of your glasses don't keep the headphones from sitting right...,326
151,"Everyone is quick to bash on Skullcandy, but in my case at least, my $35 Skullcandy's are far superior to these $15 Sony's.",326
152,"I think there are room for improvements, but for the price, it is worth purchasing.",326
153,Keep looking guys & gals.,326
154,The are good for what I need them to do,326
155,I even got a hug 3 days ago from the 9 year old for buying them.,326
156,"If activated once to open up voice calling on my smartphone it works wonderfully, but the headset refuses to perform the action again and provides a low-pitch beep that does little more than annoy.",326
157,***The huge downfall to these headphones is there is NO OVERHEAD CUSION.,326
158,I've tried turning them up as loud as I could with volume on my iPhone and on the headphones and they still aren't that loud.,326
159,I like the overall rating of this headphone.,326
160,These will be great for traveling.,326
161,"They arrived quickly, are simple and intuitive to use and sound good and last a good while before needing to be recharged.",326
162,"For the price (less than 15 bucks), the headphones are working well.",326
163,"But they look
pretty cool and i may recommend the seller.",326
164,"Someone suggested buying a pair of headphones instead of IEM's, and I was in a target one day ruiing the loss of my earbuds and bought these.",326
165,One hand operation.,326
166,Bass was lacking and vocals seemed muffled.,326
167,"These did the trick, and for less than 20 dollars.",326
168,"The microphone does not register anything at all until you are speaking at COMICALLY LOUD VOLUMES, and my guildies on ventrilo tell me the mic sounds like I'm yelling into an old time radio inside a tin can underwater.",326
169,They are hard plastic with little give.,326
170,The sound comes out clearly and they stay on pretty well as i jog.,326
171,Super comfy because I don't have to shove a plug into my ear.,326
172,These solve both problems!,326
173,I got his Sony set and I love them.,326
174,Got these for my son for school and they work great.,326
175,"The chord was a bit shorter than I would prefer, but other than that it's fine.",327
176,I got these to replace in-ear headphones because I'm prone to ear infections but geez even with the volume turned way up they don't block outside noise at all.,327
177,The device wouldn't charge at all so it was basically rendered useless.,327
178,1 is the cord is very short.,327
179,The midranges and the highs serve to add dimension and overall they are biased pretty well.,327
180,I would love to give these 5 stars.....but these have their issues.,327
181,"Dont come here and be a musician that whats super uber quality, I'm not a musican and I love them!",327
182,I'm returning them and will investigate if it was just a manufacturing issue.,327
183,This is actually my second Sony MDRZX100 headphones.,327
184,"Even without moving them a little bit, they are not like similar styles of headphones, that hurt my ears or pinched my head ..",327
185,These aren't really either.,327
186,I have them on now as I write this review.,327
187,Plenty loud enough for most users and insanely long battery life.,327
188,I listen to a lot of audio books and love these ear phones for than.,327
189,It's been 4 years since i've bought them and they are still going strong!,327
190,"No, I don't have a huge head.",327
191,Bono's voice sounds greater than ever!,327
192,They fit  a little tight at first but I got used to them.,327
193,I recommend these as a good-looking pair to wear in public.,327
194,The fit isn't quite as snug as I'd like and the headphones tend to move around slightly while jogging.,327
195,The headphones work well and its not too loud.,327
196,The 240's i'm dissappointed with.,327
197,Talk about cool in a restaurant.,327
198,"Generally, hardware with SONY written on the side of it performs well.",327
199,"So far I'm not having any problems with one-side going out, no strange noises.",327
200,"+ Build quality (headset)
Pretty good for $20.",328
201,"I wouldn't recommend them for DJing or producing, since they do not at all have ""Studio Quality"" sound.",328
202,"I'm not an audio nerd, so my review is just based on an average user who distinguishes headphones by ""it sounds good"" or ""it doesnt sound too great.""",328
203,"Also, to everyone who buys $200 headphones: ""You got ripped off.""",328
204,"The sound on these are better than Apple headphones, I can assure you of that.",328
205,i put these headphones through a lot of crap.,328
206,We bought these for our son and they broke within 90 days.,328
207,"The speaker began to crackle in my left ear (it sounded as if it was max volume out of that ear, while the right ear was working normally at the set volume).",328
208,"I like the sound quality, it has good tones and the bass is pretty good too, something that I love to hear in my music.",328
209,"This is more the style of the earphone class, and not particular to this model.",328
210,"They are fine for the price, but I would consider spending more for a better product.",328
211,"Comfortable, and sound quality is decent enough you don't hate life.",328
212,"Everything breaks form Sony these days, including headphones.",328
213,>>The covering over the ear-pads has ripped around the inside speaker.,328
214,Only think I wish it did was fold up for compatibility... Other than that I'm a satisfied mommy!,328
215,I bought them for around $20 and it was honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made.,328
216,Perfect for travelers who are looking for fewer wires to mess with while lounging at the airport.,328
217,Sound is pretty good for under $30.,328
218,"The new Apple earbuds stay in my ears pretty well, but the wire is a hassle during a workout.",328
219,"If it does, nothing tape can't fix.",328
220,I also wear hearing aids and these work great and are comfortable over them.,328
221,They are great and he loves them.,328
222,They are also as it stated on arrival-refurbished.,328
223,These are some kind of thin synthetic leather-like material with foam inside.,328
224,It is a great set of headphones for the price.,328
225,Both sets died within a week of each other.,329
226,The cord is around 4 ft. in length but it is not bulky.,329
227,"When the opportunity arose, I bought the ZX300 to see if there really was a difference.",329
228,"2) When used longer, it tends to get really warm in your ears.",329
229,The headphones arrived quickly and worked well.,329
230,I would always wear my cord under my shirt to minimize the snagging which works alright until I start sweating.,329
231,I'm REALLY suprised by all the 1 and 2 star reviews.,329
232,These give me the ability to move around and continue my life while she does that.,329
233,All three are in great working condition and my kids do a good job of working them.,329
234,"You'll be fine listening to rap and hip-hop, but stuff like dubstep, with alot of bass, would sound bad.",329
235,These have good sound but are not what I would call fasntastic and they are also not noise canceling.,329
236,All in all I think it's a great product for the price,329
237,"There is some getting used to the controls- volume, pause, bluetooth, etc.",329
238,Fantastic value.,329
239,It's a good set of headphones for the price.,329
240,I wear glasses and its just a quick adjustment when putting them on to compensate for over the ear wearing.,329
241,"For the price, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.",329
242,The earbuds are heavily padded and soft as well.,329
243,"Sometimes I can keep a connection on the opposite side of my house from my iPhone 4S (yes, I know it's dated, but come on!).",329
244,"From my wife's point of view, they are light weight, comfortable on her head, and sound very good.",329
245,My last pair were with me for daily use for almost 4 years and only had to be replaced when my cat helpfully chewed through the cord.,329
246,"But, they just mean you can hear the cord moving when the headphones are on, and it's not even a problem.",329
247,It came on time as well.,329
248,I've been through a few head phones so I was something of a skeptic.,329
249,"Eventually, after falling to the ground and two years of general abuse they started to fail.",329
250,"They're great for that, and so much more.",330
251,I also really like the buttons on the side for adjusting the volume; they're perfect for when you're listening to music away from your computer.,330
252,"All other affordable headphones have only lasted me a few months, so, needless to say, I was very pleased with this pair.",330
253,*Bluetooth connectivity was a breeze (I have a Pantech Marauder android phone that found the head phones in 5 seconds).,330
254,The new headset paired immediately with my phone and tablet.,330
255,I've bought these headphones like 4 times in a row now.,330
256,I was mad but when I put on the head phones I was very happy!,330
257,There is no warning anywhere that you shouldn't use it for more intense workouts.,330
258,I got one for my self then got two more for family.,330
259,"If I'm wearing earrings, it's unbearable for even a minute, but even without, it feels very tight.",330
260,The battery lasts with average usage 10 or so hours.,330
261,Bono's voice sounds greater than ever!,330
262,Packaged well and arrived quickly!,330
263,I was a little worried that these would be junk... but they are awesome.,330
264,"Could use a little wider volume range, but for the price, it's an AWESOME product!",330
265,I love these headphones.,330
266,They get fairly loud and Don't distort at high volume.,330
267,Also better construction than I dreamed for the price.,330
268,Bought for myself.,330
269,"Although they are mainly plastic, they are quite durable as I've used them virtually everyday since I purchased them in January of this year.",330
270,Read one review that made me think twice about this product where a customer said not for people with large head size however I am not the smallest guy and these phones fit me just fine.,330
271,I love these headphones!,330
272,I use my Kinivo headphones every day on the way to work and during my clerical day where all I do is data entry.,330
273,I have had many Sony products over the yrs and have always been impressed.,330
274,The earpads rotate so it is more compact.,330
275,"This model is replacing the better quality, better sounding MDR-V150 model.",331
276,"Nothing fancy but for the price, what else do you need?",331
277,"but still not a bad buy for simple, yet good headset.",331
278,Only wish they worked properly and that they felt comfy on my ears.,331
279,They don't move around when I run.,331
280,"I can actually hear the bass of my music thrumming now and have found myself getting startled occasionally, even, as they pick up softer sounds in the background of my music that I had not previously heard.",331
281,"So, I purchased these headphones 18 months ago and I honestly was happy with them at first.",331
282,This pair must have a short it never stays connected it beeps all day long going in and out.,331
283,Packaged well and arrived quickly!,331
284,"+ Build quality (headset)
Pretty good for $20.",331
285,"As the subject says, the poor audio cable caused crackling on the slightest movements.",331
286,"They either don't fit my ears right, pop out, or short out.",331
287,I did a lot of research before finally purchasing these and I am happy with my decision.,331
288,"I really like the red color in the right side, that makes it look nice.",331
289,"So... my current earbuds NOW are a pair of Sharp earbuds, that came with an old cell phone, and are intended for phone use.",331
290,"Once the call ended, the music came right back.",331
291,"That said, the instructions for all of these tasks were abundantly clear.",331
292,I bought these so that my partner did not have to listen to my music.,331
293,"I was a little concerned when I found these headphones on Amazon because they had such great reviews and tons of them, at a great price, but I had never heard of the brand, nor had any of my friends, but I couldn't pass them up.",331
294,"I love all your other products, but these are big and bulky (I know, you can clearly tell that by the photo) and hurt the shell of my ears.",331
295,"The cords are thicker than my old headphones, but other than that, i love it!",331
296,The sound is muffled and sometimes distorts the low end if you're listening to a song with a lot of it.,331
297,I assume the headset's connecting wire  is supposed to ride along the back side of the neck or head.,331
298,Here's a hint: EQ them.,331
299,My previous pair lasted over two years while being used daily by my two boys ages 16 and 10.,331
300,Then let's talk about how they make your ears sweat alot!,332
301,Such a basic headset and the wire connections get loose?,332
302,"Clear sounds, lightweight, easy to wear.",332
303,Owned for over 6 months and still very happy.,332
304,Always buy new ones!,332
305,"If he wouldn't have kept them I would have given them a 2, but he thinks they're just fine and hasn't experienced any issues with them.",332
306,After hrs of research I decided this was the headset for me...,332
307,"Even worse, it's terribly uncomfortable to wear.",332
308,Fit is fair too.,332
309,Not the best sound quality but considering the price they are as good as most headphones in the $30-$70 range.,332
310,Comfy headphones that do not bother me after prolonged usage.,332
311,Bass was lacking and vocals seemed muffled.,332
312,Bought in January.,332
313,Bought these for my son.,332
314,Probably the 300 offers a better bass quality.,332
315,"Even though these $20 headphones aren't it the same league as those, they are amazing for the price point.",332
316,I only gave the second star because it was so difficult to find headphones without that useless noise canceling.,332
317,They are exactly what I wanted I got them for my husband for Christmas and he loves he works in a factory with loud machines all around him and with these the noise is not a problem all He  could hear is  his music,332
318,It holds the charge the whole time I've used it too.,332
319,(The working part of the aids are outside the ear.),332
320,I felt they were going to fall off at any moment.,332
321,Would buy another pair if I needed one.,332
322,Durability is pretty good on this one.,332
323,I've owned the BHT220 for years...they finally started acting up so I jumped to these.,332
324,Provides descent quality sound and are durable.,332
325,"Again, they're pretty cheap material, but they can hold their own.",333
326,"They are comfortable and deliver great sound, but the cord is a smidge short and doesn't allow much freedom of movement.",333
327,Great for the average ipod music lover or for watching movies on the ipad!!!,333
328,This is my second pair - after owning the 220s for a year or more I got the 240s for my wife for exercising and she likes them a lot.,333
329,I really like these!,333
330,"Cons:
Don't get too loud
Bass is nothing compared to my cheaper, in-ear buds.",333
331,And there was no way to adjust them so they would stay.,333
332,"I have only had this for about a week and have not used it for music, so I cant speak to that.",333
333,I like the way you can easily fold them to make them fit in your backpack or in a pouch for protection.,333
334,"I've only used them for a day, but so far they are making a good impression.",333
335,They are snug and perhaps painful with extended use.,333
336,A great purchase!!!!,333
337,The fit of the headphones is fine.,333
338,"I got some earbuds after that, but honestly I hate them more than anything, so I was so happy when I found these on Amazon.",333
339,"This can happen even if I'm right next to my phone and outdoors, so I'm not sure if that eliminates the Bluetooth and cellular connections as the culprits.",333
340,I purchased these a year ago along with a portable DVD player for our car.,333
341,"Some of the button functions, such as play/pause, are not instantaneous.",333
342,I would buy them again but my current ones don't look anywhere close to breaking.,333
343,Be mindful of this if you have a bigger head.,333
344,"When they came in the mail, he was thrilled.",333
345,"Pros:
> The speakers can swivel and rest flat.",333
346,"I mainly purchased these headphones for their nice white and black look which matches my HTC phone, their call quality and being able to control music from the heaphones is fantastic.",333
347,"While I haven't used a measuring tape, I can easily walk around my entire fitness facility and never lose connection.",333
348,"The headphones themselves are hard to keep attached to the ears, at least mine, falling off frequently with light movement.",333
349,Well worth the buy.,333
350,"But for the price, I think that these are way more than worth it if you need a cheap pair of headphones that will last you longer than twinkies in the post nuclear world.",334
351,"My first pair that I bought years ago stopped holding a charge, so I switched brands.",334
352,These are light and comfortable for long periods - I wear them all day at work.,334
353,I wish I would have spent a bit more money and purchased ones with oval ear cups instead.,334
354,(I am not a heavy figure).,334
355,"- Very affordable

Cons:
  - No battery indicator, but it starts beeping in your ear when it's getting low.",334
356,"It keeps cutting out, or warbling distortedly.",334
357,I don't think they are.,334
358,"2) They are uncomfortable to wear
3) They look funny when you wear them in public.",334
359,"sound is OK. the best use is for working out at the gym, and you don't have to use the loaners they have there.",334
360,My wife has been using BTH 220 for 2 years without any issue so i decided to order the newer version.,334
361,I probably got a lemon.,334
362,They still work as well as they did the day I got them.,334
363,If you have hair this probably won't be an issue but its worth a mention.,334
364,"I basically put these on at 8, and leave them on until 6.",334
365,They are perfect for my needs.,334
366,"Except that it's not for people with small head, it is a great product for casual listening",334
367,I paired it with the TaoTronics TT-BA02 Wireless Portable Bluetooth Stereo Music Transmitter.,334
368,"The sound cuts a bit if you're moving around a lot, I wore then as I mowed my lawn, but for the most part, 'they're okay.",334
369,These came to me broken and I think that stands as a testament to the poor build quality on these headphones.,334
370,My mothers pair have stopped working after about a year.,334
371,They also stay put.,334
372,They bluetooth well and do just what they say.,334
373,"I think there are room for improvements, but for the price, it is worth purchasing.",334
374,"It isn't much weight, though.",334
375,Hurt my head within 15 minutes.,335
376,What I don't like is the sense that it lacks a little oomph.,335
377,Gave them to my husband hoping his larger head will stretch them out for me :),335
378,Maybe it's because I have a big head.,335
379,I paired it with the TaoTronics TT-BA02 Wireless Portable Bluetooth Stereo Music Transmitter.,335
380,I suppose this thing is good for rock or rap...when deep bass pounding is wanted.,335
381,Here's a hint: EQ them.,335
382,They sound ok - especially after the in ear wired set I was using started to drive me crazy.,335
383,It's just where bluetooth technology is.,335
384,"For the price, these are unbeatable.",335
385,I have to turn off the bluetooth on my phone and then take unit off to shut down.,335
386,My son also eecieved Beats headphones for Christmas and prefers these..,335
387,"Anyway, with all the other headphones at the same price range that exist out there, I just returned them and bought something else.",335
388,"if i had the chance and some extra cash, i will eventually switch to something more comfortable that i can wear for a long period for work.",335
389,So far so good.,335
390,"Also, to everyone who buys $200 headphones: ""You got ripped off.""",335
391,"It seems like they have definitely worked the bugs out of these, at least for my use.",335
392,"Really good sound quality, and a fairly comfortable fit.",335
393,"While I viewed them as a holdover until I could afford something higher-end like the Jaybirds Bluebuds X, I may end up putting off that decision longer than I anticipated!",335
394,"good for rock and hip hop, pop music.",335
395,"They sound better, but still not great..  None of my recent headphone purchases can match my 20 year old, cheap digital headphones, which are starting to fall apart...:(  These do look great, though.",335
396,I bought them to use at my desk at work and they are good for that.,335
397,"I gave them 5 stars because at this price, you WILL NOT find headphones that sound better.",335
398,"I'm a musician so I'm always looking for great studio heaphones or personal monitors, these headphones are worth every penny!",335
399,It holds the charge the whole time I've used it too.,335
400,I purchased these a year ago along with a portable DVD player for our car.,336
401,Spend the extra 10-20 to get some sturdy headphones with padding.,336
402,The box of the earphone was opened a bit but they did mention that may happen but they arrived safe and sound.,336
403,The biggest gripe I have with them is just how NOT loud they are.,336
404,I was worried that the area where the ears would rest would be stiff and not be very comfortable against my ears.,336
405,But I knew this had to be just a bad unit.,336
406,The headset works as advertised.,336
407,I have them on now as I write this review.,336
408,The battery would not hold a charge after just 1 month of usage.,336
409,"Just like the price of these headphones, the quality is also low.",336
410,These things have fabulous sound and range.,336
411,They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these).,336
412,I am very satisfied for the quality of the headphones.,336
413,I was really surprised at the sound quality and also how comfortable this headphone is.,336
414,"If your going to buy these take care of them, if you don't then it will definitely break.",336
415,They stick out a lot and make you look funny.,336
416,My boy bought this headphone with his own money and I just tried it on today to see how a $15 Sony headphone sound.,336
417,I even did a side by side comparison to the Beats and very comparable in sound just not as deep of bass as the Beats.,336
418,Not too shabby for the price dynamic range 8 out of 10 depends on the output of you're system at my age 40+ hendrix and clapton always sound like gods.,336
419,I readjust how they sit every once in a while.,336
420,I had the same problem as the first reviewer...won't hold a charge.,336
421,"One instance last week I got up to about 30 or 40 feet before it started to drop out, although there was also a wall separating me and my phone.",336
422,Controls are easily accessible.,336
423,He loves them and we are extremely happy.,336
424,This makes the headset unstable and renders the unit useless.,336
425,These headphones are hard to beat for the price.,337
426,Easy to set up and control.,337
427,"When you consider the cost for the Beats verses the cost for these headphones , it became an easy decision to make

I find these headphones to be more than I would have thought in regards to the sound quality.",337
428,"I didn't expect much for under $20, but if you consider yourself even slightly more concerned with quality than the average user, I'd get something else.",337
429,Obviously the quality isn't great compared to high end models but for the price they are a great buy.,337
430,"I bought this as a recommendation from Matt Ogus, professional bodybuilder.",337
431,"My crazy suggestion would be to have some type of small mic that can drop down closer to the mouth if on a call, then just snap back up if not on a call.",337
432,These have a really good sound for the price.,337
433,"Battery life seems okay, but I tend to just keep mine on the charger when they are not in use.",337
434,I readjust how they sit every once in a while.,337
435,They even fold up to stow away in my cargo shorts.,337
436,"Bought these on: August 8, 2014.",337
437,"I did shake my head and they didn't fall off, but I still had the uneasy feeling about them.",337
438,"For the price, Yeh they're worth $15 but not much more.",337
439,I bought 2 pairs of head phone for a long trip to Asia.,337
440,Overall it is a good product that I use on a daily basis!,337
441,And my workouts are pretty long so I'm impressed.,337
442,"Not bad, was a little leary of buying them since they were so cheap but thought I'd try the out since they are Sony brand.",337
443,"For anyone that complains about the sound quality, THEY ARE $15.00.",337
444,I ended up donating them to our local thrift store after one use.,337
445,I just picked up the SONY MDR-ZX100 headphones today and for the small amount I paid I can't believe the big sound I am getting with them.,337
446,I highly recommend them.,337
447,These broke after about 2 months of use.,337
448,They are not as comfortable on my head as the old Motorola they are replacing after 6 years but they also cost less than 1/2 of the old unit.,337
449,"Read the description before you buy it then get it then complain about it not being noise canceling, these weren't made to cancel out noise, just slightly muffle them out.",337
450,I will continue to purchase these headphones whenever they wear out!,338
451,No matter what brand.,338
452,"Since these cover the ear, I figured I'd give them a shot.",338
453,I bought this for my 14-year-old.,338
454,The pair they replaced lasted TWO YEARS until they fell into a hot tub.,338
455,The distance says up to 30ft.,338
456,"the small hole in my mac which apple calls as ""speaker"" sounds better than this.",338
457,Maybe wear them with a hat.,338
458,"So basically the warm, good looking, great sounding headphones!",338
459,"Amazing sound and good bass, but the headphones did not look good when you had them on.",338
460,Turn it up and jam!!!,338
461,Do yourselves a favor and a little extra money on better headphones!,338
462,The fit of the headphones is fine.,338
463,They are not noise canceling and they are bulky.,338
464,Excellent for these purposes.,338
465,"The customer service for this product is outstanding and do the right job to get the job
done in time.",338
466,"I have already recommended them to three of my friends, and would have definitely paid at least twice the price for these headphones.",338
467,"The ones I had were actually Sony, and more expensive than these headphones!!!!",338
468,"The sound on these are better than Apple headphones, I can assure you of that.",338
469,"I didn't expect much for under $20, but if you consider yourself even slightly more concerned with quality than the average user, I'd get something else.",338
470,"Although they are mainly plastic, they are quite durable as I've used them virtually everyday since I purchased them in January of this year.",338
471,I have dropped them once or twice and they still work.,338
472,"There is no tone definition, very muddy sounding.",338
473,I'm listening to them now and they have very good sound with good base.,338
474,The backbone of the headset rests behind your head on your neck.,338
475,"Durable, great quality.",339
476,They also fit fine with my glasses on without pinching which is something I was worried about.,339
477,"Great sound, quality, and bass for the price.",339
478,"just bought these headphones and they work pretty well, the only little cons of them is the short wire length and they look weird when wearing them.",339
479,These headsets are awesome.,339
480,I would love to give these 5 stars.....but these have their issues.,339
481,They also got pressed into service as my primary headphones.,339
482,"In addition, they are bulky and don't allow for leaning on anything.",339
483,It's really good on its cheap price.,339
484,Easy to configure and use.,339
485,Seem ambient enough.,339
486,The only problem is they should use a better quality covering over the foam ear muffs.,339
487,I hated these headphones.,339
488,"My sister bought these for me for Christmas, they were on my wishlist, regardless, they are awesome.",339
489,These are almost too good to be true.,339
490,"Cons:
 - Although they were comfortable, they hurt my ears after prolonged wear.",339
491,"That being said, I purchased these for my 14yr old son for Xmas for his mp3.",339
492,I was a little worried that these would be junk... but they are awesome.,339
493,"My light never dims, and the power never comes on when I unplug and hit the power on button.",339
494,I have been having multiple issues with the microphone input of the NEXUS 4 phone.,339
495,I have had mine for about two years and they are in perfect quality.,339
496,These lasted me a good year and half before they gave out on me :( They were amazing for the price and will be sorely missed.,339
497,"The wife liked them so much for the gym, she had me order her a second set to wear at work.",339
498,"Call quality is even exceptional, though I try not to use them for that purpose, as I tend to talk a magnitude or two louder when I use them.",339
499,I've looked at all the other Bluetooth headset on here and this one was my number one choice and #1 recommended.,339
500,I ordered these to use strictly at my computer because I wanted the household noise to be blocked out.,340
501,They stay on well even with the sweat and the sound is decent considering the price point of 25.00 I ordered another set for my partner who spends a lot of time doing yard work.,340
502,"Bottom line was that they provided very good sound quality and fit well on everyone's head, from my giant noggin down to my then-preschooler.",340
503,"But i wish they weren't white, because it got dirty on the inside VERY quick.. Other than that, they were absolutley WONDERFUL",340
504,:)  These push against my cartilage after a while.,340
505,I have tried them out and can't find a thing wrong with them.,340
506,After hrs of research I decided this was the headset for me...,340
507,i think they are better then just basic ear budds.,340
508,"Don't expect to get the best pair of headphones ever, but I've found that they're probably worth at least 30 or 35 dollars.",340
509,"Choose to go forward or backward , answer your phone, recall the last number.",340
510,"For that reason, and for the fact that I wanted a better sound experience, I got on the hunt for good headphones.",340
511,I can't use earbuds and corded phones are such a nuisance.,340
512,These headphones are the perfect mixture of BOTH.,340
513,Item is bent out of shape so I cannot even return it.,340
514,Not to loud either so you don't blow the cones out of them lol.,340
515,I bought this back in 2014 for school and just to relax with.,340
516,"I don't use it for phone calls much; it's not ideal for calls, but it works.",340
517,If one side just had a nub or braille I'd have a much easier time making sure they were on the right way (and this would also make them friendly for the blind).,340
518,My only complaint... No padding on the headband does start to hurt the top of my head but I will like just glue a strip of phone to the underside and call it good.,340
519,Very good volume.,340
520,I looked at several different makes and models and decided to try these.,340
521,"For anyone that complains about the sound quality, THEY ARE $15.00.",340
522,"What's even worse is that when the battery gets low, these will emit a series of loud beeps in your ears that signal the battery is about to die.",340
523,So if you're looking for bass you can literally feel (like many headphones provide) these are not for you.,340
524,Headphones will not pair with my computer.,340
525,The only feature they have is earpieces that cover the full ear canal opening to muffle external sound waves.,341
526,"For the price of these headphones, they're actually pretty good.",341
527,"The audio quality, however, was more akin to the $3 headphones that you get on an airplane to watch a movie, and those headphones are meant to be disposable.",341
528,"My main issue is that they keep cutting out, like multiple times in the length of a single song.",341
529,"Songs that I've listened to for years, I can hear so clearly.",341
530,"I've had these headphones for about three months of heavy use and wear, and they work great.",341
531,I really look forward to the times when there isn't a lot of background noise and I get to put these on.,341
532,Even worse with glasses.,341
533,I love these headphones.,341
534,Now if you're expecting a high end sterophile experience then look elsewhere.,341
535,I stongly recommend in investing in these headphones.,341
536,I am sure it would work fine if I wanted music playing on it the entire time.,341
537,"Yes I know they are 15 bucks, but I really expected more given the reviews on Amazon.",341
538,I just want to upgrade.,341
539,For the price a quality product,341
540,I tethered the locking velvet pouch to the outside of my back-pack for easy access and to keep them safe from my textbooks.,341
541,There is about a half inch of space between the back portion of the headphones that are suppose to rest on the back of your head.,341
542,The range isn't too bad either.,341
543,great headphones in my opinion better than beats but leak alot of sound and they fit well i have an afro and they are big enough to go over that so they please me and they handle bass well,341
544,"I understand there's instant nostalgia once you realize you're no longer wire bound and your arms are all free and nilly, but trust me read this first.",341
545,I wanted to experiment with bluetooth headphones and these were a solid but low cost way to try them out.,341
546,Price is okay for the quality.,341
547,"""I listen to my radio at a reasonable volume.""",341
548,So I am a regular gym goer and I use my headphone while working out.,341
549,"I bought two of them, one for each of my daughters.",341
550,"Read the description before you buy it then get it then complain about it not being noise canceling, these weren't made to cancel out noise, just slightly muffle them out.",342
551,A nice purchase.,342
552,"For that reason, and for the fact that I wanted a better sound experience, I got on the hunt for good headphones.",342
553,Folds up to make it an easy carry.,342
554,"Cons:
 - Although they were comfortable, they hurt my ears after prolonged wear.",342
555,"When my old headphones broke, I did some research on Amazon to try and find a good replacement with a reasonable price tag.",342
556,Still worth the price though!,342
557,Not recommend this to anyone!,342
558,"Both models respond well to my phone's EQ app, letting me boost the deep bass and highest treble.",342
559,These headphones... Wow.,342
560,I told everyone I know about this product.,342
561,They cover your ears well and are adjustable.,342
562,However the ear piece is really soft so that balance out the tight grip.,342
563,"I can't recommend this item, and I hope they can improve the headphones.",342
564,I bought and returned a number of headphones the past few weeks.,342
565,Do not make the same mistake .,342
566,I honestly would have returned it but was too lazy.,342
567,"My only complaint is that they're described as ""noise cancelling"" and they definitely are not.",342
568,SONY did a good job as a big brand should,342
569,And by the time I realized this I was out of the return window.,342
570,Perfect for me at work.,342
571,These headphones can get pretty loud too.,342
572,I would not recommend traveling with these.,342
573,"Hey Joel,

I like the earphones.",342
574,"They are comfortable, block out outside noise, and have good audio quality.",342
575,These are fine.,343
576,This seems to be common for a lot of these inexpensive headsets.,343
577,These were also a gift and my daughter loves them.,343
578,You can only hear the voices.,343
579,These headphones have great clarity listening to music with ample bass.,343
580,I need looking for the noise canceling headphone.,343
581,Affordable too!,343
582,We could hardly hear it.,343
583,Not sure if this is a wake up call or a warning or something.,343
584,There are both coach style buses and city style buses on my route and I'm able to hear over both.,343
585,"All in all it is worth buying I recommend doing so for music,phone calls, and Skype or other online chat.",343
586,The bass was surprisingly strong and the mids and highs were acceptable for phones at this price.,343
587,"In fact, a co-worker is so impressed as well that she is going to order a pair for herself!",343
588,"The sound is quite good even on a crowded airplane; the padding around the ears is very comfortable, but also hasn't peeled or frayed.",343
589,"It seems best for walkers, joggers, cyclists.",343
590,I now have a Sony professional series for $99 which is amazing compared to this $15.,343
591,I would have given 5 stars had the cable been longer.,343
592,"It's hard to figure out how to fold it up properly, not a big deal.",343
593,Cups/cans are too small to go around your ear.,343
594,Does not feel flimsy at all.,343
595,But maybe I am used to earbuds.,343
596,My only complaint is with the fit.,343
597,I am very disappointed now though.,343
598,Clear sound and good microphone.,343
599,On my PC when I want to use the headphones I just power them up and wait about 10 seconds or so.,343
600,"Maybe I got a defective product or something, but the volume that I hear things on this headphone is just way too low and because of that it makes it seem like I am listening to everything through muddy water.",344
601,The sound is amazing and clear and they are extremely comfortable even after wearing them for hours.,344
602,If I wanted something high end I would of paid high end money.,344
603,Decent paid of mid-level head phones.,344
604,"Despite their compact on-ear size, these are very big head friendly.",344
605,I plan on taking better care of these.,344
606,"I wish they had a better grip though, as in a month they started to fall down if I picked something up.",344
607,sound quality is good and for the price you cant get any better.,344
608,"I also have a petite frame and, I assume, smaller head and I have lots of room in these in the back so I imagine they'd for someone with a larger head as well.",344
609,I'm giving these 5 stars only because they do sounds very good for the echeap price.,344
610,Highly recommended!,344
611,If you don't plan on laying down in these you will not have any problems.,344
612,"My light never dims, and the power never comes on when I unplug and hit the power on button.",344
613,"These headphone look stylish, contour to my head well, and sound great!!",344
614,This product is replacing my previous 4 year old SteelSeries Siberia V2.,344
615,They are snug and perhaps painful with extended use.,344
616,Unfortunately they will stop holding a charge after a month or so of everyday use.,344
617,I purchased this for my wife for Christmas.,344
618,I used 22mm stuffed into each earpad.,344
619,"Only ""problem"" is the plastic part that goes over your head doesn't bend much so it looks a little funny when you wear them, but not a big deal at all.",344
620,This is my fourth set of these headphones.,344
621,"I use them with an iPhone, and setup/pairing was quick and easy.",344
622,"Thy are not isolate quite well surrounding noise and sound, U can't wear them in noisy street.",344
623,This is my second set of these to keep separate places so I don't ever forget a pair.,344
624,"Sound is very good for an on-ear model, and you can wear them for quite awhile without discomfort.",344
625,podcasts and such.,345
626,"The sound on these are better than Apple headphones, I can assure you of that.",345
627,"After over two years they finally broke on me, one side stopped working.",345
628,I bought these headphones for $25 at a local hipster/nerd store that I frequent.,345
629,I wouldn't even consider them as an upgrade from standard ipod earbud quality.,345
630,It was simple to pair to my smartphone.,345
631,I have recommended this product to several people.,345
632,"Since these cover the ear, I figured I'd give them a shot.",345
633,"Because kids are using them, I don't want to spend a lot, but I want them to hold up a little while.",345
634,They do a great job of blocking out external sound.,345
635,Range on the bluetooth is pretty generous before the audio drops.,345
636,These look and feel great.,345
637,The only difference I see is that the BTH240 uses the same size USB cord all of the cell phones in the house seem to use.,345
638,"Outside sounds, like sounds of shrieking children while you're wearing headphones, seemed to be amplified to a piercing sound to me.",345
639,I also really like the buttons on the side for adjusting the volume; they're perfect for when you're listening to music away from your computer.,345
640,Comfy headphones that do not bother me after prolonged usage.,345
641,Bought this for my daughter to use on her tablet and in school.,345
642,It is very annoying.,345
643,"im not sure if its because i listen to them to loud or something else, but i tried not to listen to them that loud.",345
644,Just bought a second pair so my wife can listen to her audio books!,345
645,"Stop complaining about how cheap headphones aren't the best quality, I think that is supposed to be rather obvious.",345
646,and they also look awesome when i work out!,345
647,They were and they sent me a pair as well.,345
648,These are my first set of bluetooth headphones and most of my use of these is listening to audiobooks on a Samsung Galaxy Note II.,345
649,"Deep bass, yet not too overpowering.",345
650,Love the fact that they are very stylish and look more expensive that the retail price however the sound it's too low I have to turn up all the volume in order to have a nice sound,346
651,"I'm no expert, but in the quiet of my room audio quality was excellent.",346
652,"Taking into consideration the price I bought it for, $15, it is by far one of the best for its price range.",346
653,I bought these for workouts but sadly they are way too bulky.,346
654,"But, anyway, I've had no problems with the product.",346
655,"The sound is great in these things and they're not very expensive, either.",346
656,I love these!!!,346
657,"Ask them what Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) or steady-state RMS power or MP3 compression is, and usually that's the end of the conversation.",346
658,I bought a pair of beats solos and am writing this review with the Sonys on my head.,346
659,I was searching high and low for bluetooth wireless headphones to use with my iPhone and iPod.,346
660,One of the earbuds had broken making it necessary to purchase another set.,346

662,I use my headphones for listening to class lectures and writing notes.,346
663,Sound quality is acceptable for avarage not demandable user.,346
664,"Overall very satisfied - it's also very cost efficient compared to its competitors, will keep updated as far as wear and tear.",346
665,They're better than the Skullcandy 2XL's that I was replacing like Pez ... when I can hear them.,346
666,after first workout they of course got sweaty and to my shock the cushion for ear came off.,346
667,"All in all it is worth buying I recommend doing so for music,phone calls, and Skype or other online chat.",346
668,Seem ambient enough.,346
669,"The sound cuts a bit if you're moving around a lot, I wore then as I mowed my lawn, but for the most part, 'they're okay.",346
670,"During a workout, my music will gradually lower to min volume and then start beeping (because it hit the volume min limit).",346
671,"The sound is pretty good and when I use it to make calls, I've had no complaints about the microphone quality.",346
672,I'm sure others like this option but it does not fit my needs.,346
673,Definitely not a phone issue as I tried it with several other devices.,346
674,I would have liked if there was a slight gap or more of a curve.,346
675,Excellent value!,347
676,No volume setting for them at all.,347
677,Before I won new headphones I use these ones all the time.,347
678,I prefer these over the Jay bird 2s that cost $170.,347
679,"But as they are, I cannot recommend them.",347
680,"My older cousin, who knows a lot about headphones, said these sound better than her $70 headphones.",347
681,"If you live by yourself or will be using these in a quiet room, they should be fine.",347
682,I have to sit directly in front of the stereo on the floor to use them.,347
683,A nice purchase.,347
684,Good enough for me since i'm not that person who spends $$$ on audio quality...,347
685,Works fine with the phone function and with Siri.,347
686,It's more of a mechanical settle bass.,347
687,Within a couple hours my ears are really hurting.,347
688,"They came in the mail within two days of my order, which made me very pleased.",347
689,I am an editor and I use these for simple editing in coffee shops.,347
690,";-) )
They are also very comfy.",347
691,"Everything breaks form Sony these days, including headphones.",347
692,I like to listen while cleaning house.,347
693,Both are built almost identical quality wise.,347
694,All of the New Music I just down loaded sounded greater than I ever expected.,347
695,"On the left side in particular, the wire pressed against the top of my ear making it a little sore after long use.",347
696,Had to figure out best wearing configuration i.e.,347
697,"I have dropped them, yanked the cord a few times, though not ridiculously hard...",347
698,It's just where bluetooth technology is.,347
699,The only drawback was they weren't long enough to watch my tv from bed.,347
700,"They are fine for the price, but I would consider spending more for a better product.",348
701,One hand operation.,348
702,I ordered another pair and they came right away.,348
703,"For $15, these are probably some of the best sounding headphones you can buy.",348
704,"For instance, the leatherette has not peeled off even though I use it almost daily at the gym.",348
705,Highly recommend this product.,348
706,They come with a micro usb charging cable and a velvet-like pouch for storage.,348
707,I also wear hearing aids and these work great and are comfortable over them.,348
708,This is still great after a year.,348
709,"Got these headphones based on a review in a magazine, and it was spot on.",348
710,After hrs of research I decided this was the headset for me...,348
711,If anyone knows where I can buy a cushion over the top of these please contact me chkaczsn@yahoo.com,348
712,Can't believe these were so highly rated.,348
713,"Also, while it is lightly sitting on ear, it also isolates the noise pretty well.",348
714,Highly recommended.,348
715,Price: Amazing price!,348
716,We're totally satisfied with product .,348
717,I've had these headphones for all of one day.,348
718,These have about half the distance before signal cuts out.,348
719,"For those of you don't need the volume up quite as high like for walking or watching a dvd in a car, etc.",348
720,Sony is a great brand got the white  color.,348
721,"If your thinking Beats or Bose, just try these first and save your self an arm or a leg.",348
722,The sound is decent nothing to heavy as far as bass which is fine because the noise cancellation makes up for some of the downsides.,348
723,"Anyway, with all the other headphones at the same price range that exist out there, I just returned them and bought something else.",348
724,Much better than I expected.,348
725,Then finally the exterior bridge that holds the phones on the bar broke.,349
726,Great headphones for $15.,349
727,They are great for working out as well; just make sure you wipe them clean when you towel off since they are not waterproof.,349
728,"#1 TV audio for me, #2 keep the wife tuned out.",349
729,"I doubt they're good enough for a plane, but for a dorm or most bus rides you should be very isolated.",349
730,"These are NOT noise-cancelling headphones, of course, but the design features are pretty good for the under-$20 price.",349
731,"Also, the padding around the earpieces is quite comfortable and doesn't allow much sound leakage at all.",349
732,"These headphones are Better Sounding, (better balance; highs are crisper/less muted), Better Quality, Better Fitting, Pair Easier, oh, and are HALF what I paid for Rocketfish...  Major Home Run!",349
733,I love the kid but I really love those ATH-50's and I'm not willing  to make the sacrifice on this particular subject.,349
734,guess i'll be returning these Sony ones and forking up the extra $30 bucks for another pair of Sennheisers.,349
735,"For $15 not bad, but most of these reviews are very deceiving.",349
736,"I basically put these on at 8, and leave them on until 6.",349
737,"I'd rather pay more for better quality, but even the more expensive ones from Sony that are similar to this, have the same problems.",349
738,"As the subject says, the poor audio cable caused crackling on the slightest movements.",349
739,The video here is a video from my channel on YouTube -- ONOTech.,349
740,I'm also a musician (bass) and  I think the music quality is very good.,349
741,I compared them to the audio with a friend's Beats Solo HD ($199) and to be honest they sounded almost exactly the same.,349
742,Easy bluetooth connectivity to the iphone and ipad and good battery life.,349
743,"I listen to different kinds of music, pop, rap, instrumental, Polynesian, classical, etc.",349
744,"I use them as my everyday ones now, and they are very comfortable.",349
745,They also get a little loose occasionally and the screws need to be tightened once in a while (especially if you fold them up regularly).,349
746,"If star ratings were correlated with price, this would be 5 stars.",349
747,Just like other people saying the cord should be at least 6 inch longer.,349
748,"Used them on my droid but can play them very lound for some reason, i believe it is my phone though.",349
749,"Thought about giving this 3 stars but for the money, I just can't complain that much.",349
750,"They came in the mail within two days of my order, which made me very pleased.",350
751,"They could be uncomfortable if you have glasses, as the frame could get pressed against your ear.",350
752,"Wow, as another reviewer described, these are very uncomfortable, at least on my ears.",350
753,Not the fault of the manufacturer.),350
754,Why wouldnt you buy these they are perfect for jogging or taking to school to and plug into your laptop.,350
755,I had hoped to use them on airline flights but the background noise made it too difficult for me to hear dialog.,350
756,These are great headphones that block out outside noise and you need not turn the volume up to hear things clearly.,350
757,Very disappointing.,350
758,I have no idea how but there is really no way to untwist it.,350
759,I've had a Kinivo BTH240 (black) headset for well over a year and had to buy my girlfriend one too (red).,350
760,These are built to last!,350
761,"if i had to choose the price, i would price it at $34.99.",350
762,I bought two sets of these for my children (ages 4 and 6) to use on an airplane with their kindles.,350
763,If that is the purpose it is,350
764,"The sound quality is not breathtaking my any means, but I believe a very good value for the price.",350
765,They are quite light as well.,350
766,Getting a second set for my daughter.,350
767,also the controls are easy to access.,350
768,"I have, some years ago, bought these headphones and they have held up well, I will probably buy them again one day.",350
769,"I have used higher quality headphones, but they are usually too heavy for several hours of editing.",350
770,These would definitely be that product.,350
771,The battery life is out of this world.,350
772,"The leatherette ear cushions also wore out after the first year and a half, but these headphones went through a little bit of a beating in their 2 year lifespan.",350
773,"Great battery life, strong Bluetooth reception with my phone.",350
774,The headphones work well and its not too loud.,350
775,"The leatherette ear cushions also wore out after the first year and a half, but these headphones went through a little bit of a beating in their 2 year lifespan.",351
776,I need looking for the noise canceling headphone.,351
777,Price comparable to lesser models seen at Wal-Mart and the like.,351
778,They connect to all my devices.,351
779,The bass has punch (although still not going to deliver what I'm _really_ looking for) and the highs are clean.,351
780,It is perfect for taking outdoors.,351
781,These are light and comfortable for long periods - I wear them all day at work.,351
782,I would not buy again.,351
783,"Actual, serious physical pain and burning of my ears.",351
784,They have excellent sound quality and require very little charge time for a long playtime.,351
785,"They aren't audiophile headphones, but they are more than adequate; moreover, I don't have to switch headsets if I'm in a meeting and then want to drown out the office noise with music after the meeting is over.",351
786,This is a terrible headphone!!!,351
787,First off let me say I did not give this 5 stars because of its hi fidelity sound.,351
788,The padding on them makes them very comfortable.,351
789,5) No clicking sound from the buttons as reported by other users.,351
790,These headphones have great sound and cost less.,351
791,"Oh, my previous 3 pairs that this beats:
Skullcandy Hesh
Skullcandy Inked
Panasonic RP-HTX7PP (Although very very very close.",351
792,"I keep them in the outside pocket of my gym bag and they have not broken, I am a little careful with them because they are slight, but that is better than some bulky heavy monster headphones.",351
793,The frequency response was terrible.,351
794,For me it was very loose even with it clinging on my ears.,351
795,I am so pleased with this product and have already recommended it to several people!!!,351
796,Only finally found ONE image.,351
797,My sone broke his and we purchased another about a year ago.,351
798,The headphones work well and its not too loud.,351
799,"not much power under the hood coming from an ipod touch 4, and it isn't comfortable like anything you spend big bucks for.",351
800,"They sound better, but still not great..  None of my recent headphone purchases can match my 20 year old, cheap digital headphones, which are starting to fall apart...:(  These do look great, though.",352
801,This is certainly the case here as well.,352
802,"Sound in both ears is clear, they're comfortable for long periods of time, i've dropped them on numerous occasions and the plastic hasn't cracked or really scuffed at all.",352
803,Phone calls sounded great on them and were very clear.,352
804,I've purchased three pairs of these for my kids (two pairs in white/pink and one in blue/black).,352
805,I am a bigger guy with a larger head so the headset is a little tight around the back of my head.,352
806,I ordered it about a month ago agony I still don't need to charge it!,352
807,The new ones feel cheaper - including thinner and shorter cable.,352
808,Tried another brand but they weren't as nice as these by a long shot.,352
809,No issues here.,352
810,Fantastic value.,352
811,I truly feel this is the best bang for your buck headphones.,352
812,I was originally impressed at their responsiveness and proposed solution to the problem.,352
813,"Overall if you're on a budget and can't really spend more than 20 bucks on headphones go with these, you won't be disappointed.",352
814,It's pretty darn gross.,352
815,These solve both problems!,352
816,"These headphones do go quite loud, but when you crank them up, they are very bass heavy.",352
817,I wouldn't waste my money on these due to the poor design.,352
818,Surprise--there are differences.,352
819,"However 90% of the time, they work and work well.",352
820,I've had mine for over 6 months and I haven't had a single problem!,352
821,Price is okay for the quality.,352
822,I purchased these headphones because my dad wanted a pair of headphones when he went to work out and go about his daily routine.,352
823,I was cleaning the walls of my house.,352
824,I have an app on my phone with an equalizer and played around with the sound settings.,352
825,"But these are all small issues in my opinion, definitely not showstoppers.",353
826,"They work fine for music, but for you tube or vine DO NOT use these they are laggy and uncomfortable to wear.",353
827,I bought these because my cat was chewing the cords on my expensive in-ear noise-cancelling earphones.,353
828,"Purchased in late May 2015 and just discovered it died, will not charge - I got about 18 months of use out of it, but really expected more for the price (around $25 at time of purchase).",353
829,The bass was surprisingly strong and the mids and highs were acceptable for phones at this price.,353
830,I don't understand why it don't work.,353
831,Sound is okay/cool and I love that the right side has a read mark so u can easily know what side to put where.,353
832,These earphones are good but I wish they didn't feel so tight.,353
833,But I knew this had to be just a bad unit.,353
834,Then u have to keep wiggleing it to get it on both sides...  is any one else's like that?,353
835,but on the good side it would match with your clothing quite nicely.,353
836,The previous set I owned (different brand) lasted for 5 months before they crapped out.,353
837,The sound is good but the headband is so tight it gives my kids headaches.,353
838,"I used to use cheap wired headphones to listen to my podcasts, I would go through a pair a month, these have lasted me 8 months so it's a great value.",353
839,"From day 1 they were uncomfortable, but manageable and with decent sound.",353
840,Hurt my head within 15 minutes.,353
841,I use first one with my WALKMAN.,353
842,I choose the Sony's because I have enough familiarity with Sony headphones to know that they are very clean.,353
843,"I haven't tried running with these on, but I doubt they'd move at all.",353
844,"If your thinking Beats or Bose, just try these first and save your self an arm or a leg.",353
845,They are NOT noise cancelling by any means but it's definitely a bonus.,353
846,Build quality is decent.,353
847,Owned these for a little over two years with light to moderate use through that time.,353
848,Its a decent product but not what i was looking for.,353
849,Battery life is good for workouts.,353
850,"Started up my music, my music taste runs from soft instrumental to heavily based rap and rock.",354
851,"I have 4 pair just lying around the house, so that when someone wants to use them, they can.",354
852,For the price these are fantastic!,354
853,You're not going to meet those expectations with a whopping $15.,354
854,Would definitely recommend.,354
855,I wish their quality control was better.,354
856,I wanted something that would fold for transport and not have to sacrifice good sound quality.,354
857,I bought these in red at Ross for $15 because they had a discount for them.,354
858,"I'm pleased with the battery life, and charging them up is simple with any standard micro-USB charger.",354
859,It was with reservation that I tried this one from Kinivo.,354
860,"All in all a wonderful product, at an amazing price.",354
861,"The padding for the ears is way too small, and this would seem comfortable to a small child.",354
862,"I have owned many Koss's, Sennheiser's, Sony's, Audio Technica's, and even some Bose.",354
863,I need a new pair now and will try to avoid buying this model for those reasons alone.,354
864,The backbone of the headset rests behind your head on your neck.,354
865,The Sony head phones are amazing.,354
866,"Either way, they're good enough for me.",354
867,These are hands down the best headphones for this price out there.,354
868,I'm sure this plastic would snap if you twisted these too firmly or stepped on them too hard.,354
869,They stay on well even with the sweat and the sound is decent considering the price point of 25.00 I ordered another set for my partner who spends a lot of time doing yard work.,354
870,I would definitely go with these headphones,354
871,"Basically, I take VOIP calls/meetings now and I don't have to use my desk phone/home phone / cell phone.",354
872,i recommend these.,354
873,"The sound is crisp and clear, and they are pretty loud.",354
874,"Haven't tested them out as a hands-free set or for streaming music from another device (iPad, etc.).",354
875,"These headphones are wonderful, I can do all those things and more and not have to worry about a cord getting tangled or tying me to my phone.",355
876,"I just purchased them, so there's not much on durability yet, but the cord seems pretty sturdy so there's a slim chance of that breaking or being stripped of the insulation.",355
877,I prefer my in-ear jawbones for outside of gym.,355
878,I can't understand how these are so highly rated.,355
879,Now I just recieved the BTH240 and it is 2.1+EDR same as the older version.,355
880,They are durable and sound great.,355
881,"the tension of the headphones cannot be adjusted, only the length can be adjusted.",355
882,I've had them or almost a year & there has been no major breakdown or issues.,355
883,Perhaps there was a microphone upgrade of some kind.,355
884,"I think that it was designed for a no longer satisfaction, i don't want buying another one, i'm afraid i lost my money.",355
885,Well worth the price.,355
886,Just don;t expect too much for $15.,355
887,I cut the sleeve down the side to see the plug area and it had it's wires sticking out of the hole in it's side.,355
888,They are on fashion here in Ecuador and my daughters love them.,355
889,"Removing the consideration of price, I give these 3 stars.",355
890,"I don't use it for phone calls much; it's not ideal for calls, but it works.",355
891,I would turn my music up and the music just sounded like it needed to be louder with the headphones and they werent.,355
892,Honestly I rather have these than spend 200$ on a pair of beats when sound quality is superior for the price.,355
893,"The ends both turn flat, which is great for packing them in my bag with my books.",355
894,"Fit, in terms of tightness on the head ( my hat size is 7 1/4 ) is a 6 on a 1 to ten scale.",355
895,They pair nicely and hold a connection with no problem.,355
896,I used them all day long for conference calls while I walk around my office untethered.,355
897,The bass has punch (although still not going to deliver what I'm _really_ looking for) and the highs are clean.,355
898,I've had a Kinivo BTH240 (black) headset for well over a year and had to buy my girlfriend one too (red).,355
899,My previous experience with bluetooth devices seemed to have a larger range than that.,355
900,"However, it is comfortable to wear over the head, can be adjusted, has cushion for the ears, and the sound quality is actually very good.",356
901,But after 1 day of use I can hear a rattle as if something is loose in the right earpiece after just 1 day of use.,356
902,"For the price, you can't beat these headphones.",356
903,I'm really happy with this product.,356
904,"This set can be stored away flattened, you simply turn the phones in sideways.",356
905,All ambient noise will leak in and all noises created by the headphones will leak out.,356
906,These are perfect for my kids to use with the IPods or their boom boxes and using the computer to listen to music.,356
907,They definitely stick out and I caught quite a few people taking a second glance at me.,356
908,Occasionally I unknowingly hit the button and start a phone call.,356
909,The sounds is ok but not good/very good or excellent.,356
910,Then I joined a gym with the MUSIC LOOP FROM HELL.,356
911,These little headphones are great so far!,356
912,"While this a negative, I don't want to wear any headphones much longer than that anyway because it's just not good for your ears.",356
913,These are keepers.,356
914,"As far as the Kinivo BTH240s, I read the reviews and the 'tweaks' that were made to improve it made it seem like the perfect match for what I was looking for.",356
915,I'll definitely be buying these again!!,356
916,If you want your moneys worth than your gonna have to spend a little money to get the quality you want.,356
917,I have issues with headphones and I seem to go through a lot of them but I've had these for several months now and they are really perfect to me.,356
918,I'm sure this plastic would snap if you twisted these too firmly or stepped on them too hard.,356
919,she crapped out on she so soon in less than a month  tried fo retuen it but it was going to cost $19 to return almost the same amount to.purchase it.,356
920,"It's light weight, portable, comfortable, low profile easy to use and rugged.",356
921,The only complaint I have is the cord.,356
922,Poor quality manufacturing all around.,356
923,I am very satisfied for the quality of the headphones.,356
924,They are compact and lightweight.,356
925,The sound quality feedback for talking is very poor.,357
926,"They look a lot cheaper than you'd expect, even though they're so cheap.",357
927,"I purchased this Bluetooth headset to replace a Sound Bot headset that worked but always seemed clumsy, cheap and looked a bit dorky.",357
928,They continue to look nice after months of use and are easy to clean.,357
929,He immediately reacted to listening to music on both my phone or a CD player.,357
930,Only complaint - and it's a minor one - is that they pinch my glasses into my head behind the ears and it's kind of uncomfortable.,357
931,The 220s didn't have that problem.,357
932,"After a few hours of use, the drivers sound quality much improved]

I am using them with a Samsung Galaxy S4 and had no trouble connecting them, my first Bluetooth experience.",357
933,Connection gets disturbed occationally but nothing to really complain about.,357
934,"My crazy suggestion would be to have some type of small mic that can drop down closer to the mouth if on a call, then just snap back up if not on a call.",357
935,"The ear pads are super soft, and if you're planning on leaving them on your desk all the time, they will be everything you need.",357
936,"The sound is fine, exactly what you'd expect from Sony, even at $16 for the headphones.",357
937,I need a new pair now and will try to avoid buying this model for those reasons alone.,357
938,Sound is great!,357
939,I was very disapointed with the sound - needs more treble!,357
940,That will be the only negative I could find with these headphones.,357
941,"This is my second purchase, this time as a gift for my wife.",357
942,"I have had a number of Bluetooth stereo headsets including the last version of these, and I must say these are the best for the money I have found.",357
943,"i been through some good times with these headphones, Thank God for putting these headphones in my life.",357
944,Due to their wireless nature I believe these will be more durable than wired headphones.,357
945,"I think there are room for improvements, but for the price, it is worth purchasing.",357
946,Battery life is good.,357
947,They are fine for everyday listening.,357
948,"2) When used longer, it tends to get really warm in your ears.",357
949,I like them better than beats.,357
950,I find myself wearing them for hours at a time.,358
951,But the Sont MDRZX100's have really good sound quality.,358
952,"I based my purchasing decisions largely on other reviews, which led to believe that the sound quality was better than it actually is..",358
953,Still very much worth it if you don't mind having no isolation with the music off.,358
954,"For the price, you really can't beat it!",358
955,I can't hold the ipod in my hand all the time.,358
956,My daughter is happy to have it as it matches with her laptop colour and look expensive too with SONY logo on the earpieces.,358
957,"These are so comfortable that I can actually sleep in them all night if I want to, although they were not meant for that at all.",358
958,It has a good level of keeping outside noises out but not to the extent where you can't hear anything.,358
959,There is no padding on them.,358
960,Four stars includes value/affordability factors.,358
961,I use them while running and they stay in place just fine.,358
962,Would definitely recommend them!,358
963,"I thought these were going to be good quality sound, but their worst then walmart $5 headphones.",358
964,Like so many other reviews at $30 there is little room to nitpick; even if I get better headphones this will surely remain as a sportswear set.,358
965,These are hands down the worst sounding headphones I've ever owned.,358
966,The button changes don't improve or worsen my review.,358
967,"The ONLY complaint I have, which is not enough to knock off a star, is the aesthetics of these.",358
968,"Plus, I'm not super picky about anything as long as I can hear my music clearly and enjoy it.",358
969,It gets in the way when i am trying to write down notes.,358
970,"So when these were on sale, I figured why not try them.",358
971,"The sound is great, almost complete noise canceling.",358
972,I use these with my iPhone.,358
973,"Even without moving them a little bit, they are not like similar styles of headphones, that hurt my ears or pinched my head ..",358
974,I would recommend it to everyone I meet.,358
975,My daughter uses these with her studio equipment.,359
976,While the rest of the gym endures the noise bleed through their earbuds I'm deep in stereo bliss.,359
977,"We are very actively involved with exercising at the y every day and
use these wireless to listen to music as we exercise.",359
978,These are also very nice looking & look more expensive than they are.,359
979,This product works fantastic.,359
980,I like these headphones.,359
981,"I've generally been happy with the Sony products I've used, but often found them a bit pricier than similar options.",359
982,"If you're like me and listen to music or movies occasionally, these are perfect.",359
983,You have to add this to your collection.,359
984,Ripped it apart and installed in some better headphones.,359
985,Bluetooth should work within 30 feet.,359
986,I sleep with them and they don't get all tangled or bent.,359
987,My boyfriend got these headphones and he absolutely loves them.,359
988,"Decent pair of headphones, especially when you consider the price.",359
989,The only ones where 1. the don't hurt my ears 2.,359
990,He can wear his helmet while riding his bike and still use these to listen to music.,359
991,"We have been very pleased with the quality of these, especially for the money.",359
992,These headphones are great.,359
993,I would say they look better and they seemed a bit smaller around the head but overall I prefer the SoundBot's in this price range.,359
994,Batteries last ~12 hours of playback and as it turns out they work great for phone calls as well - bonus!,359
995,"And it works perfectly with my android tablet, PC, and phone.",359
996,Very impressed with the quality of the product.,359
997,They are definitely not tight around the head/ear but kind of feels like it's hanging down from my ear.,359
998,The chord isn't even compromised.,359
999,There are both coach style buses and city style buses on my route and I'm able to hear over both.,359
1000,I don't use them every day but I have had these for 2 years almost and they are going strong.,360
1001,"That being said, I purchased these for my 14yr old son for Xmas for his mp3.",360
1002,The only thing I didn't like was that after a bit the top of my head where the band goes across gets warm ... but that also happens if I so much as wear a hat.,360
1003,"They are small, so the sound quality is not what you would get with a good pair of speakers or headphones and fall out of your ears.",360
1004,"The connection to my phone is great, so I can have it in my bag instead of a pocket like with a wired set.",360
1005,"Also, they didn't share room well with my glasses.",360
1006,Even just walking around the neighborhood is OK as they cut back on traffic noise.,360
1007,Nothing sounds distorted or shrill.,360
1008,Save money and time here.,360
1009,I needed a cheap pair of head phones that I was hoping would give decent sound.,360
1010,"I have used higher quality headphones, but they are usually too heavy for several hours of editing.",360
1011,Poor quality manufacturing all around.,360
1012,I looked at the manufacturer's photos and I am wearing them properly.,360
1013,These have definitely delivered on this front.,360
1014,I have bought two sony headphones in my lifetime.,360
1015,I can't wait to wear them to the gym tomorrow:),360
1016,If not for the jack being as pictured I would have given this product 5 stars.,360
1017,"I think either the technology is still evolving or better technology is still costly or else, speakers at this cost are meant to be this way.",360
1018,"For the cost of these, you just can't go wrong.",360
1019,Highly recommend.,360
1020,The price is very cheap for what they're worth.,360
1021,"couldn't stand it, so i stuffed toilet paper in a plastic bag and wrapped it all up in duct tape.",360
1022,First off let me say I did not give this 5 stars because of its hi fidelity sound.,360
1023,"Oh, my previous 3 pairs that this beats:
Skullcandy Hesh
Skullcandy Inked
Panasonic RP-HTX7PP (Although very very very close.",360
1024,For headphones made by Sony this is a great deal.,360
1025,Really only good thing about them is they hold charge very well.,361
1026,These are hands down the best headphones for this price out there.,361
1027,one word amazing!!,361
1028,"You can pay a lot more but for a basic head set for your grand kids, this is the one.",361
1029,Happy with the price point and glad I purchased them.,361
1030,But I'll survive.,361
1031,I usually don't have any issues with these headphones.,361
1032,These are very nice.,361
1033,"Things with lots of bass (movies, dance music) have good punch.",361
1034,"I recommend these to anyone that wants a good, affordable pair of headphones!",361
1035,"I wasn't about to pay $200 for a pair of Beats for her, these look nice, and work very well for the price.",361
1036,(I am not a heavy figure).,361
1037,Even used it for Skype/Ventrilo/Mumble/etc voice services on the computer.,361
1038,I switched to these after trying Bluetooth earbuds because the buds did not stay in my ears even with minimum activity.,361
1039,"Sounds beautifully, but the cord is just too short.",361
1040,Then I accidentally snapped them in half lol because I thought they were fold able ( completely my fault; just know that they aren't fold able).,361
1041,"I understand there's instant nostalgia once you realize you're no longer wire bound and your arms are all free and nilly, but trust me read this first.",361
1042,I'm 5 foot 8 and I suspect my head is about average size for my height and they fit perfectly.,361
1043,"I'll be one of the dissenters who says they sound good, but not as good as the MDR-V150s they replaced.",361
1044,"Sony has had their ups and downs over the years (eh hem, PS4...), but at least they are unwilling to license their name to a total piece of junk.",361
1045,Cons: the plastic that goes around the ear and behind the head is hard and does not flex.,361
1046,I loved them so much I wore them out.,361
1047,"When I watch shows on my computer, the sound is much more ""well rounded"" and accurate than when I play it through my computer speakers.",361
1048,Quality build you'd expect from Sony as well as quality sound.,361
1049,"I'm sure some people could care less about that, so take my review for what it is, my opinion.",361
1050,"Not only is the sound quality excellent (again, not compared to Sennheiser or other premium brands), but they are also amazingly durable.",362
1051,These got through 4-5 days before they needed to be charged.,362
1052,"My only complaint is that they're not that great at blocking out external noises - on a crowded bus or subway, I have to turn up my volume almost all the way to hear my music properly.",362
1053,"The audio quality, however, was more akin to the $3 headphones that you get on an airplane to watch a movie, and those headphones are meant to be disposable.",362
1054,Long term durability is questionable at best.,362
1055,I saw several people during my travels wearing these headphones so I would guess they are fairly popular.,362
1056,I got these for my daughter's 12th birthday and she loves them.,362
1057,Definitely a good buy.,362
1058,"The treble is generally a little low, but you can change your EQ settings and it'll be fine.",362
1059,Happy with the price point and glad I purchased them.,362
1060,The  red light was on while plugged in.,362
1061,I only gave the second star because it was so difficult to find headphones without that useless noise canceling.,362
1062,My boyfriend got these headphones and he absolutely loves them.,362
1063,These head phone are still over the ear.,362
1064,My biggest complaint is that I can't lay down with them on as the headband runs across the back of the head and is very uncomfortable to lie/lay on.,362
1065,The fit is not quite as comfortable as some I've tried.,362
1066,"I use them as my everyday ones now, and they are very comfortable.",362
1067,"I'll have to continue using my older headphones over these, but I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.",362
1068,"For the price (less than 15 bucks), the headphones are working well.",362
1069,"It's fake leather, so little black flecks of fabric will start to appear on your ears as they break apart.",362
1070,"It would be nice if they folded into a travel pouch, but with all their other virtues plus the low price I'm not complaining.",362
1071,"The ""Red"" band on the right side, denotes which ear which is good since it's very hard to read the symbols telling you otherwise.",362
1072,Over a month later and it's still there.,362
1073,after first workout they of course got sweaty and to my shock the cushion for ear came off.,362
1074,Sony is a great brand got the white  color.,362
1075,The greatest pair of cheap headphones.,363
1076,The packaging was opened when I received these headphones.,363
1077,"I tried other brands and they were okay, but ultimately proved to either be a bit uncomfortable (too rigid) or the speakers would get damaged with the least amount of moisture (sweat).",363
1078,They deliver very good sound with this receiver.,363
1079,The first set had the speaks go out and the same thing happened to the second set.,363
1080,I bought this headphone because it looks cool and carries a Sony name.,363
1081,"Now it's better than new because the cable is longer,  and better quality than the flimsy cable it came with.",363
1082,The bass was surprisingly strong and the mids and highs were acceptable for phones at this price.,363
1083,"Love the headphones, works well.",363
1084,"These ones lasted through running in snow, rain, heat.",363
1085,"UPDATE: After a couple years of being dropped, stepped on, and listened to, these still work.",363
1086,The only reason I didn't give it four stars was the occasional cracking noise that I would hear when moving to a distant area from the Bluetooth device but that seems common in any Bluetooth device.,363
1087,I had hoped to use them on airline flights but the background noise made it too difficult for me to hear dialog.,363
1088,Sound is clear.,363
1089,I switched to these after trying Bluetooth earbuds because the buds did not stay in my ears even with minimum activity.,363
1090,They sound great for the price and are very durable.,363
1091,I do recommend these headphones for general use.,363
1092,You're not going to meet those expectations with a whopping $15.,363
1093,"these are great little headphones, I was expecting them to be bulkier from the other reviews .",363
1094,"The sound quality is great, and they do block outside noise pretty well (not noise cancelling like my others, but decent for most uses.)",363
1095,"It has a perfect sound, of course we can not compare with other more expensive headphones, but it is great!",363
1096,"Things with lots of bass (movies, dance music) have good punch.",363
1097,But it fits on the ears in such a way that it hurts the ears after listening for a while; say 30min.,363
1098,"These always hurt the top of my head, even after I take them off!",363
1099,I love these things.,363
1100,Oh mey gerd...I ordered a pair of headphones and guess what I got?!,364
1101,Better volume and overall fit and finish than prior model.,364
1102,"Well, I think that because the headphone jack on my custom computer build is quite tight, it causes a spacer to break off.",364
1103,This is the only headphones my daughter does not break within two weeks.,364
1104,"Frame is little bit loose or weak, so it is comfort but easily come off.",364
1105,The Kinivo BTH240 is my 3rd pair of bluetooth stereo headphones.,364
1106,"Would certainly buy from them again, hopefully these hold up to the daily use while hubby works out",364
1107,As a telephone - sound quality when receiving and sending - I was not as impressed.,364
1108,There are other Sennheiser options in the sub-20 dollar range that have much better sound than these.,364
1109,"The buttons are easily accessible, but they do sit flush with the hardware, so it's a little tough to tell if you're finger's in the right place if you're wearing gloves.",364
1110,It's easy to set up and having all the controls on one of headphones is a big plus.,364
1111,It is annoying enough that I have gone back to a wired set of headphones.,364
1112,"However, it does it's job quite well overall.",364
1113,Now the right one is starting to go out as well.,364
1114,Great for the average ipod music lover or for watching movies on the ipad!!!,364
1115,"Only $25 bucks so we can expect the world, but a solid $25 investment.",364
1116,Due to their wireless nature I believe these will be more durable than wired headphones.,364
1117,"Its sturdy and can withstand abuse (tossing it onto the table, for example) and the wires are thicker than your average $5 headphones.",364
1118,"I would expect three weeks out of a pair of ear buds I got from the dollar store, but not from a well-reviewed, kinda pricey set of headphones!",364
1119,-The design of the cushions as well as the tension in the headband make these headphones hard to wear for more than 10 minutes.,364
1120,"As usual, the cord seems to be about 6 inches shorter than I need.",364
1121,This Sony product is the best stereo headphone I have purchased to date and it exceeded my expectations.,364
1122,"I made sure they were well taken care of, but maybe I used them too much.",364
1123,Light an fit his little ears and head with no problem.,364
1124,Love that they fold flat and can be stored in a briefcase of backpack.,364
1125,But my apple earbuds have lasted much longer than that.,365
1126,Battery life is amazing!!,365
1127,"So I'll write the review with that usage in mind:

Pros:  It's lightweight on your head and is comfortable as you move around.",365
1128,"The earlier pairs I had were decent, they'd last about 6 months then just stop working.",365
1129,I listen to books on my 12 hour shift and often forget to charge it until it finally begins to die on the third day.,365
1130,"They were easy to connect to my iPad, and sound good and have pretty good range.",365
1131,It's just pure cheap!,365
1132,"I basically put these on at 8, and leave them on until 6.",365
1133,Great headphones and a great price.,365
1134,"I wasn't expecting great sound quality for the price, but I did expect them to work.",365
1135,"As you can tell by looking at the photos, there is not any room between the plastic top of the headphones and the headphones themselves.",365
1136,"Artic has a large LED, on/off light you can't miss.",365
1137,Good for working out and casual listening.,365
1138,Everthing you liked abou the older version is great accept the newfound bulk.,365
1139,"Sound, comfort ex.",365
1140,"So great, some jerk at work stole them from me.",365
1141,"I thought they sounded great, I'm sure others are better but these are so cost effective I could buy a pair for less then $30 which is amazing.",365
1142,Great headphones.,365
1143,This is NOT Amazon's fault.,365
1144,Bought these for my son.,365
1145,These got through 4-5 days before they needed to be charged.,365
1146,Maybe wear them with a hat.,365
1147,"There was always something missing: Bad fit, poor sound quality, lack of comfort, etc.",365
1148,This is actually my second Sony MDRZX100 headphones.,365
1149,I was skeptical when I purchased these headphones because of the low price.,365
1150,I am a bit of an audiophile and purchased MDRZX100/White for a non-music related work.,366
1151,The head set is incredibly comfy and folds up very nicely.,366
1152,They are quite light as well.,366
1153,I ordered it about a month ago agony I still don't need to charge it!,366
1154,Super durable I guess.,366
1155,Good quality headphones.,366
1156,They produce crisp high's and nice bass with balanced midrange.,366
1157,They paired with my iPod and my Galaxy 3 Droid phone effortlessly.,366
1158,Audio quality and clarity is much better than expected.,366
1159,After receiving this product I discovered that it didn't live up to my expectations.,366
1160,I like the white color and the red detail.,366
1161,Cord is decent as it should be but top is very cheap plastic.,366
1162,I have already grown accustomed to not fighting wires.,366
1163,"The MDR-ZX100 easily slips off your head, doesn't adjust tightly and sounds very low, no matter how high you turn your volume up.",366
1164,"The ear cups pivot to fold flat, and fit in the shallow drawer of my media cabinet.",366
1165,Perhaps someone reading this review will have an idea.,366
1166,"Overall they are, for lack of a better term, balanced.",366
1167,I can use them for an hour or so without getting tired of them.,366
1168,No volume setting for them at all.,366
1169,"I don't care much about audio quality beyond a certain level of competence, but have gone through dozens of headphone models, and these are decent on that count, certainly better than your typical earbuds.",366
1170,I will keep an eye but so far so good!,366
1171,I find them very comfortable and the white on white color scheme is very sharp.,366
1172,They are very light and compact as well.,366
1173,"Comfortable, and sound quality is decent enough you don't hate life.",366
1174,"Works well as cell phone bluetooth, but does NOT work with LG TV as I was hoping!",366
1175,"They sound fine, and work okay if I am sitting still..",367
1176,Everthing you liked abou the older version is great accept the newfound bulk.,367
1177,I bought and returned a number of headphones the past few weeks.,367
1178,We have bought several versions of these headphones.,367
1179,The package was nice and not hard to unwrap.,367
1180,"Constantly skips, or disconnects and refuses to reconnect to my computer.",367

1183,These are perfect for what I need.,367
1184,"They are comfortable, adjusts easily and i thought they were very affordable.",367
1185,"Honestly, I had never heard of Kinivo, but after trying them I found them to be comfortable AND capable of withstanding some sweat.",367
1186,"I have used them on a run, several times at the gym and to walk my dog.",367
1187,"I have ridiculously rude neighbors, and these help drown out the noise.",367
1188,They are not very comfortable.,367
1189,I purchased these to use as hands free calling.,367
1190,I have been useing ear buds for so long I forgot how nice a set of headphones can be.,367
1191,"I use them at work, at the gym.",367

1196,I bought this headphone because it looks cool and carries a Sony name.,367
1197,The Artic seems better on the bass range.,367
1198,The kids use these with their tablets to watch movies in the car and leave me alone.,367
1199,I found out that after a couple of months of use one of the headphone does not work anymore.,367
1200,Great for the money!,368
1201,They addressed my issue immediately and issued a refund.,368
1202,Highly recommended for anyone who wants something good that will last.,368
1203,Excellent for these purposes.,368
1204,"With that out of the way, I think they are a better value then what I paid.",368
1205,Cups/cans are too small to go around your ear.,368
1206,"The sound quality is more improved than the original, and while these headphones do not isolate the user from his or her surroundings, the audio quality is still very crisp and clear.",368
1207,You can wear them for a long time without getting a headache (also note that I have a big head and a lot of hair so this tends to be a problem for me).,368
1208,If you are looking for legit stereo sound without paying an outrageous amount these are for you.,368
1209,Fortunately I still had my old ear buds so was able to make it through the movie.,368
1210,I let them know what the problem was and they had it fixed w/i 3 days.,368
1211,"I had the older vesion of these headphones and those were lightweight, and suprisingly, built like a tank.",368
1212,"However, it does it's job quite well overall.",368
1213,"they may be a bit ""old school"" but I have difficulty with the in the ear thingies  that come with phones and mp3 players.",368
1214,"And yet, my 4+ year old pair, with cushions that are completely worn out, are really great, and very comfortable to wear!",368
1215,"impressive range and sound...paired, worked easily out of the box.",368
1216,gonna order a couple more on payday,368
1217,But it's a good deal for what I'm using it for.,368
1218,But they get the job done.,368
1219,"I have tried multiple phones and eventually they all disconnect for a moment depending on whether the phone is upside down, or which pocket I have the phone in.",368
1220,So a nice design.,368
1221,Until one side of the headphones stopped working.,368
1222,"They fit securely but comfortably around the ears, and I haven't experienced any issue with them wanting to come off during workouts.",368
1223,He's loves them.,368
1224,"I don't expect bose quality on a $30 pair of headphones, but they are pretty darn good!",368
1225,"The only downside is the lack of microphone, and fact that they don't fold up as nicely as other pairs.",369
1226,I rarely use it.,369
1227,Bluetooth should work within 30 feet.,369
1228,Also style is beautiful.,369

1230,"All in all, I would highly recommend these headphones and have recommended them to friends on several occasions.",369

1234,"I use these at work every day while I program, and I have no complaints.",369

1237,Had them for only about a few weeks and they are busted....just buy something else.,369
1238,I widely recommend the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Headphone.,369

1240,"As far as compatibility, the work with Windows Laptop, Windows Phone (1520 and 920 used), as well as any of our Samsung Galaxy devices.",369
1241,I wear X-Large hats so have a large head but these headphones are comfortable for a few hours wear.,369
1242,"You can even hear some decent bass at a moderate volume, but keep in mind these are small, cheap headphones, not a subwoofer.",369
1243,Will see how it holds up long term.,369
1244,They seem way more robust than the V150s too.,369
1245,The only reason they get a 4 is because of the slight rattle of the buttons and time I had to spend getting them to my comfort level.,369
1246,"One instance last week I got up to about 30 or 40 feet before it started to drop out, although there was also a wall separating me and my phone.",369
1247,Cord is really short - come on Sony!,369
1248,"Not my first choice when I am chillin at home and listening to Drake or Coldplay but since hands free is the standard for drinving now and wires just plain suck, these headphones hit the mark.",369
1249,I have purchased these headphones twice and I am 100 percent sure that I will not buy another pair of over the head headphones from another company.,369
1250,I would definitely buy them again!,370
1251,Thinkin about ordering another pair for home.,370
1252,"The other set still function and work as expected, but extended high volume finally took its toll on the speakers.",370
1253,"I've had these headphones for about three months of heavy use and wear, and they work great.",370
1254,"I'm no expert, but in the quiet of my room audio quality was excellent.",370
1255,"Overall these are the best pair of Stereo Bluetooth headphones I've ever used and I've tried Plantronics, Motorola 305's and Sony.",370
1256,I truly feel this is the best bang for your buck headphones.,370
1257,"The playback controls work well in Android, but only work in native apps on Windows Surface, not in web apps.",370
1258,"They offer a lot of volume, great when walking, running, working around the house or mowing the yard.",370

1260,"Sometimes I will remove just one side so I can have a quick conversation with someone, letting the music continue rather than hitting pause.",370
1261,I could not imagine having these in white.,370
1262,they fold up and fit nicely in his backpack.,370
1263,Sound Quality (4 stars): Sound quality is enjoyable.,370
1264,They had offered to send me out a new pair.,370
1265,The only drawback was they weren't long enough to watch my tv from bed.,370
1266,"They are small, really small.",370
1267,"Before I bought these, I asked myself if these were really worth it, but it was worth it.",370
1268,"Best for skinny head people (me = 7.25"" ear to ear)",370
1269,"The sound quality is good even for on-the-ear style, so that is a redeeming quality.",370
1270,"For the price, these are unbeatable.",370
1271,The sound quality isn't so good but the looks and brand name of Sony alone make up for it.,370
1272,I have no idea how but there is really no way to untwist it.,370
1273,In my opinion these are so much better than the crap beats by dre.,370
1274,I use them almost every day for at least an hour.,370
1275,"Plug doesn't fit my macbook pro; too loose, keeps falling out.",371
1276,I have used these twice in major rain storms and haven't missed a beat!!,371
1277,You get the value of your money.,371
1278,Not sure how long they will last as they feel flimsy;time will tell.,371
1279,They connect super easy to bluetooth and I can walk pretty much all over the house with little to no interruption.,371
1280,I can't believe the quality of it.,371
1281,Now I can listen in comfort.,371

1283,I looked at several different makes and models and decided to try these.,371
1284,So buy New from another seller.,371

1286,"I was able to put it back in and use it still, but it pops out still every now and again.",371
1287,"I got some earbuds after that, but honestly I hate them more than anything, so I was so happy when I found these on Amazon.",371
1288,I love good bass and these guys deliver without being overpowering.,371
1289,Other than that they are very good.,371
1290,Comfortable and they stay on my head very well.,371
1291,The build quality on this pair is much higher however.,371
1292,It has pretty long range too?,371
1293,I have bought Bluetooth headphones before and they were always poor sounding when bass kicked in.,371
1294,"On the calls I've tried, it works just fine.",371
1295,The headset came nicely packaged and there was a USB charging cable provided.,371
1296,"As many said in other review,  these headphones are a bit large.",371
1297,"I'm sure they'll be put to good use, but if you get too rowdy @ the ""Ponder the Mystery Party"", Baby these  are comin' out!",371
1298,She uses them with her iPod shuffle or watching movies on the computer.,371
1299,Could just be my particular unit but other than that I'm really satisfied with my purchase.,371
1300,The Motorola's being to hurt the insides of my ears after extended wear.,372

1304,Color: Black I have purchased 3 of these and one has lasted for several years.,372
1305,"Bass was good, but the mids and highs were not as clear, actually a little muddy and muffled.",372
1306,UPATE: Their customer service notified me after reading this review and sent me a new paid to replace the pair with the power issue.,372
1307,The quality for the price is simply amazing.,372
1308,"I find these comfortable, contrary to some reviewers, I wear a 7 1/2 baseball type cap.",372
1309,For $25 bucks they're damn good.,372
1310,I am happy with the purchase overall and would recommend them -- just to someone with a bigger head or bigger ears.,372
1311,"In fact, the performance is as good, or even better, than more expensive models under a 100 bucks (i had tested quite a few before buying these).",372
1312,Shipped from amazon and got it the next morning (I'm a prime member so I don't know if it'll be that fast for everyone),372

1317,"Dont come here and be a musician that whats super uber quality, I'm not a musican and I love them!",372
1318,First pair lasted 22 months with no issue.,372
1319,"It gives a nice sound quality though, it's worth the buy.",372
1320,"The ear piece is a bit big, but you get an amazing sound from them almost like stereo head srt.",372
1321,"I use them with an iPhone, and setup/pairing was quick and easy.",372
1322,another thing i am a hardcore music lisitner  usually me ears start to buzz when im throu the first 4 hors but with these i could last 8 hors then i had to take them off for 30 min,372
1323,i recommend these.,372
1324,That alone is worth 5-stars.,372
1325,the next time you go shopping.,373
1326,"Every time I turned on these headphones, it typically would take a couple seconds longer to sync up with my phone than other Bluetooth headphones I've used in the past.",373
1327,The cushioning on these old ones fell apart long ago.,373
1328,The Sony seems pretty solid though.,373
1329,I also wanted wireless because I didn't want to be tied to my iPad - I wanted to be able to move around and do things while listening.,373
1330,"but for about $25, these have become my most reliable workout buddies for the past 3 months, in spite of my manhandling and excessive perspiration.",373
1331,As a result music lacks clarity that you'll find in higher quality headphones.,373

1335,Range is easily to into the next room of my electronically noisy house.,373

1352,$15 for over the ear headphones is a good price.,374

1354,These headphones were exactly what I was looking for.,374

1359,Volume and Track control right on the ear for great hands free use.,374

1362,They don't really stay in place for me when I am working out and they do cause some slight discomfort behind the ears for me.,374
1363,"Not expensive, but not cheap.",374
1364,"Really Sony, 3 ft?",374
1365,Perfect for starter headphones before you spend hundreds on others.,374

1369,"Sound is good (not Bose or anything, but I think it is pretty good for listening to Pandora and computer stuff), and they are super confortable.",374
1370,"but still not a bad buy for simple, yet good headset.",374
1371,"I like the Kinivo, and I will continue searching for a different BT transmitter that will hopefully pair successfully.",374
1372,They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these).,374
1373,A great headset at an affordable price.,374
1374,I'm going to use it to watch videos.,374
1375,Much better than I expected.,375

1379,"While they aren't advertised as sweat proof, I have sweated out buckets with these on and have had no effect on usage!",375
1380,"2) The headband does not have any padding, and this caused a little bit of discomfort for me.",375

1382,Great for wearing for long periods of time!,375
1383,I've paired this with my Note2 and macbook air with no issues.,375

1385,"Even with these nitpicks, I still give these 5/5 stars.",375
1386,I like them so much!!,375
1387,"After poking around the sound properties for this device, I found that it was set to Telephony quality sound format (single channel) with no option to upgrade it to CD or DVD quality (which I thought was pretty much the standard these days).",375
1388,My first set got me through most of a three-year stint at college before my continued abuse of the wires finally shorted out one ear.,375
1389,I've only given them a 4 star because I've only had them for 2 weeks :) we'll see how things go in the months to come :),375
1390,"I was really blown away when I first listened to these, because they greatly exceeded my expectations.",375
1391,My daughter is happy to have it as it matches with her laptop colour and look expensive too with SONY logo on the earpieces.,375

1394,I am not a techo geek.,375

1404,I felt it was a great purchase for this price.,376
1405,That's what the money buys and no more.,376
1406,"On the calls I've tried, it works just fine.",376
1407,These sound just as good.,376
1408,Sony and every other manufacturer of headphones apparently thinks the headphones are used on commercial aircraft where the connection to the audio source  is only 30 inches away.,376

1415,I use these primarily for listening to training videos or low volume music when reading.,376
1416,If you're looking for a pair of headphones as an audiophile I wouldn't recommend these.,376

1422,I would personally recommend these headphones.,376

1435,"Only lasted a few months of infrequent, gentle use.",377
1436,Paired right away with no issues.,377
1437,"Not deep, but decent.",377
1438,"The company is not aiming to produce a pair of stellar-quality headphones at under $20, just a pair that will suffice for the average user.",377

1477,"However they are definitely the best cheapest headphones I have ever used, and I will be buying the updated model from Sony.",379
1478,(Very similar to the Dell version I bought about 5 years ago for $60.),379
1479,"Overall, I would recommend these to anyone and if these ever break, I will be back for another pair.",379

1493,I wasn't disappointed.,379

1504,They're better than the Skullcandy 2XL's that I was replacing like Pez ... when I can hear them.,380
1505,"They're not high end headphones by any means, but they sound great for the price and they don't seem to randomly stop working after 8 months like other low price headphones do.",380

1512,I was looking for decent over-the-ear headphones and found these on Amazon.,380
1513,Does not look genuine sony product.,380

1535,Some people have talked about the lack of bass.,381
1536,The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that I was hoping it would fit over my ears and not sit on them.,381
1537,I didn't realize how much I missed the bass that my earbuds didn't supply.,381
1538,It's actually big enough for regular people.,381
1539,"The headphone is functioning properly,good sound,good mic reception, easy to configure.",381
1540,"The adapter is L shapped and bulky so if you have a case on your device (we are using a tablet), it is difficult to plug into it.",381

1869,Just like other people saying the cord should be at least 6 inch longer.,394
1870,The headphones themselves are very light and very comfortable on my head but the bad noise coming from the left speaker is always there.,394
1871,Battery last for me about 9 hours on full charge while at work listening to music for that entire time.,394
1872,I ended up donating them to our local thrift store after one use.,394
1873,I can't use them if I am trying to work on stuff beside my computer.,394
1874,"My crazy suggestion would be to have some type of small mic that can drop down closer to the mouth if on a call, then just snap back up if not on a call.",394
1875,I bought these for 29 dollars and they beat out headsets that have an msrp of three times the price.,395
1876,"Anyway, with all the other headphones at the same price range that exist out there, I just returned them and bought something else.",395
1877,"Up to now it works fine, no music ""skipped"" at all.",395
1878,"Good sound, fine bass that does not overpower the mids and highs.",395
1879,They fit really nice.,395
1880,I do recommend these headphones for general use.,395
1881,My mothers pair have stopped working after about a year.,395
1882,I cut the sleeve down the side to see the plug area and it had it's wires sticking out of the hole in it's side.,395
1883,"These are lightweight, don't crush my head, decent sound and the cord is just the right length.",395
1884,I can connect even during a call.,395
1885,Work great for everyday use and the battery life seems good.,395
1886,They are exactly like the picture looks.,395
1887,The bass is disappointing by being barely audible and sounding muffled and unclear.,395
1888,I've carried them in my Targus messenger bag for the past couple of months with ease.,395
1889,Not perfect but what do you want for 30 bucks.,395
1890,"I have enough slack to wear these headphones comfortably, but once in a while they get yanked off.",395
1891,I'm amazed at the stereo separation achieved with a wireless signal.,395
1892,But I can't figure out how to adjust skype on Ubuntu with it.,395
1893,I recommend buying these.,395
1894,They don't completely cover your ear but the sound quality is very well put together.,395
1895,Can be comfortably worn for about 3 hours before the ear cushioning becomes flat and starts to hurt ear cartilage.,395
1896,"Overall: decent headphones, obviously they're $15 so they're not great, but they do good enough.",395
1897,"Eye Glasses, earbuds,  scarves.",395
1898,Occasionally I unknowingly hit the button and start a phone call.,395
1899,They don't completely cover your ear but the sound quality is very well put together.,395
1900,I think these were aimed at teens and tweens with smaller heads.,396
1901,"Rather sturdy, feels like it won't break too easily, I'll let you know how that goes.",396
1902,"Secondly, the ear cups don't swivel nearly as much as the older ones did, which makes it difficult to place them on your head.",396
1903,"Pros: easy to connect, clear connection, compact

Cons: not tight enough on my ears nor my husband's therefore does not block out much background noise/other music at the gym

Overall, I am disappointed.",396
1904,Will people find something about them to complain about...Yes.,396
1905,"EXCEPTIONAL CLEAN SOUND, comfortable and can be worn with a bike or motorcycle helmet.",396
1906,I have not had to charge them yet!,396
1907,The kids use these with their tablets to watch movies in the car and leave me alone.,396
1908,"After touching and using the product Kinivo, Arctic, Soundbot ranging from $20 - $36 are going to be about the same quality in sound.",396
1909,I would definitely recommend them!,396
1910,"They are compatible with every music/sound device that I own like my laptop, phone, mp3 player and radio.",396
1911,The kids use these with their tablets to watch movies in the car and leave me alone.,396
1912,"They are small, so the sound quality is not what you would get with a good pair of speakers or headphones and fall out of your ears.",396
1913,The only negative is the material around the headphones has started to peel off.,396
1914,I use these daily and love them!,396
1915,The white makes them fun too.,396
1916,As I expected of a Sony product and more.,396
1917,"The sound is pretty good and when I use it to make calls, I've had no complaints about the microphone quality.",396
1918,Good quality headphones.,396
1919,I used them all day long for conference calls while I walk around my office untethered.,396
1920,I've had them for about 8 workouts now and they've been great!,396
1921,I will give these headphones 5 stars based on price.,396
1922,WIll deal with again,396
1923,"I'm still on the fence on if I'll be trying another product from the company or not, because I really did feel it was an exceptional product for the price before the incident.",396
1924,Wont be disappointed it gets the job done.,396
1925,Those could break easily.,397
1926,Cannot get the headphones to pair with any bluetooth items.,397
1927,He blows through earbuds like they are nothing!,397
1928,Range is easily to into the next room of my electronically noisy house.,397
1929,"These are NOT noise-cancelling headphones, of course, but the design features are pretty good for the under-$20 price.",397
1930,"My Bose headphones died after ten years of hard use, so I bought these thinking they would be a good temporary set until I chose a more permanent set.",397
1931,The volume and skip track buttons give off a loud click when depressed; that click is amplified right next to the ear.,397
1932,I just gave that headset to my son when he went to college and bought the BHT240.,397
1933,The pair they replaced lasted TWO YEARS until they fell into a hot tub.,397
1934,I would recommend either one and will most likey buy myself the Artic based on good base in any position.,397
1935,"Sound is good (not Bose or anything, but I think it is pretty good for listening to Pandora and computer stuff), and they are super confortable.",397
1936,I sleep with them and they don't get all tangled or bent.,397
1937,This headset was exactly what I needed!,397
1938,I even did a side by side comparison to the Beats and very comparable in sound just not as deep of bass as the Beats.,397
1939,Sony and every other manufacturer of headphones apparently thinks the headphones are used on commercial aircraft where the connection to the audio source  is only 30 inches away.,397
1940,I have the Hopper from Dish and just had to program them in and now I can listened to the music or my shows all over the house...lol I am spoiled and the tone is absolutely wonderful!,397
1941,I was amazed by the quality of these headphones.,397
1942,Just no comparison in my opinion.,397
1943,"After I bought these, I noticed that a lot of people have them which is not surprising.",397
1944,The headphones deliver good volume with decent fidelity -  perfect for watching movies.,397
1945,"I always tell it like it is, the bad along with the good.",397
1946,"Songs that I've listened to for years, I can hear so clearly.",397
1947,Love the color and the sound is great!!!!,397
1948,I have to physically move the sound system's volume meter to be able to reach.,397
1949,"So, these are decent for the price and for style which is what I prefer (ie neckband with full ear muff).",397
1950,"Normally I'm not one to write negative reviews, but yikes, I'm pretty dissatisfied with these headphones, even for the $20 I paid.",398
1951,"Regardless, the headphones produce studio quality sound and even though they were white and used, there was not one indication as far as discoloration goes that they were used at all.",398
1952,Been wearing them since.,398
1953,"I was looking for a BT Headset without a boom mic, similar to my Motorola S305 which is incredibly quirky with Win7.",398
1954,The ear pads were ok for a short time but also became uncomfortable after extended periods of use.,398
1955,Also syncing took a great deal of attempts and time to work.,398
1956,I switched to these after trying Bluetooth earbuds because the buds did not stay in my ears even with minimum activity.,398
1957,I use my phone for listening to music or audiobooks while driving and watching movies or my droidtv when I'm not.,398
1958,these headphones are great.,398
1959,I bought these for 29 dollars and they beat out headsets that have an msrp of three times the price.,398
1960,They aren't amazing by any means and at times seems a little fuzzy.,398
1961,"- Very affordable

Cons:
  - No battery indicator, but it starts beeping in your ear when it's getting low.",398
1962,"For the price and style, you cannot go wrong in buying these headphones.",398
1963,Definitely a good buy.,398
1964,The base response is good.,398
1965,"So I'll write the review with that usage in mind:

Pros:  It's lightweight on your head and is comfortable as you move around.",398
1966,"They are great for around the house listening, and as my first bluetooth headphones, they have greatly increased the amount of music and podcasts I listen to arond the house, mostly from my tablet.",398
1967,"It's certainly adequate, but impossible to describe as loud.",398
1968,"Needless to say, I am returning this item.",398
1969,I don't recommend these,398
1970,"Bottom line was that they provided very good sound quality and fit well on everyone's head, from my giant noggin down to my then-preschooler.",398
1971,These headphones have great style and sound.,398
1972,"This worked fine, but I did replace it with an $80 Logitech.",398
1973,These sound just as good.,398
1974,"These headphone look stylish, contour to my head well, and sound great!!",398
1975,Durability is pretty good on this one.,399
1976,These are not the best headphones ever but the sound quality is about the same as a pair of $100 headphones.,399
1977,These aren't anything special.,399
1978,The shipping was fast and product as described.,399
1979,It hurt my head to wear them for any longer than 10 minutes.,399
1980,"One minor irritation is that the back of the headphone, that is, the plastic link between the earpieces, gets in the way, if I am leaning on my sofa or lying down,  If that part could be made thinner and adjustable, it would be a five star product",399
1981,Very disappointed!!,399
1982,He is also picky.,399
1983,Incoming phone call?,399
1984,The distance says up to 30ft.,399
1985,I can tell I have a headset on when talking to others but they all say they cant tell one bit that I was on my headset!,399
1986,I though it was kool that i was jamming out to Iheart radio at the gym the other day and my song pauses and i hear thing ringing and push the ear piece answer button on the side of the head phones and a super clear hands free phone call.,399
1987,I recommend these to all people,399
1988,"Fit to ear is comfortable, although it is little tight.",399
1989,Just recently started to experience distortion in one of the ear pieces.,399
1990,I like the compact size as well.,399
1991,Able to block out my surroundings and the long wires make it easy for me to move around freely.,399
1992,"There is that rattle when jostled (say, during a run/jog) that others have posted.",399
1993,"I am a smallish woman with a small head and small ears and there was no way to wear these comfortably, or even in a way that made them feel they would stay on my ears.",399
1994,The last time I bought a pair of nice Sony headphones they cost about $60 for the same quality.,399
1995,You don't have to go through that process every time.,399
1996,"Please do yourself a favor and grab a pair of these, you won't regret it.",399
1997,The headphones looked nice but no matter what I tried I could not get sound in both right and left sides.,399
1998,"Well, here we are a year later and one of the speakers doesn't work.",399
1999,A little staticky when touched by where you plug the cord in to your device.,399
2000,A really great buy!,400
2001,Everything in electronics is black it seems.,400
2002,I purchased them to listen to audiobooks on various devices.,400
2003,He uses them often with his iPod.,400
2004,Perfect for starter headphones before you spend hundreds on others.,400
2005,I would always wear my cord under my shirt to minimize the snagging which works alright until I start sweating.,400
2006,"To that end, I'll be trying the 66 Audio BTS+ next, to see if they're any better.",400
2007,I love these headphones!,400

2010,They are not noise canceling and they are bulky.,400
2011,"Oh, my previous 3 pairs that this beats:
Skullcandy Hesh

2024,"Rather than sticking straight out of the laptop, this plug inserts into the laptop socket and lies along the edge of the laptop.",400
2025,I will just say you should probably get lil more expensive headphones,401
2026,Can't wait to go full force in the gym with these.,401
2027,"So far, so good.",401
2028,I wear them to the gym.,401
2029,That may be the headphones or it may be the cellular signal where I'm at or where the listener is at.,401
2030,I bought for my son to use during the time he watches the IPAD but it didn't last long enough.,401

2067,I got these to replace in-ear headphones because I'm prone to ear infections but geez even with the volume turned way up they don't block outside noise at all.,402

2094,"Typically less than a second, but occasionally stretches longer for short periods.",403
2095,"They are extremely loud, which is great in a way because you know the button is actually pressed, but at the same time, isn't very appealing when you're listening to something at a low volume or have overly sensitive ears.",403

2146,These headphones are fine for a normal sized person like my little wifey.,405
2147,"i don't use headphones alot and wasn't going to spend over $100 for a pair,this pair i like a lot, good sound,not to loud but loud enough,i use it at the gym",405
2148,I'll update my review once I sweat in these for a month or so during workouts.,405
2149,"SO because of that, I am reordering another of the same pair now in April 2016.",405
2150,The battery life is amazing after all this time I still get a full 8 hours of talk time.,406
2151,"Over the years, the cushion that rests on your years has turned into flakes so now I have the sponge material left over.",406
2152,"So, these are decent for the price and for style which is what I prefer (ie neckband with full ear muff).",406
2153,These are hands down the worst sounding headphones I've ever owned.,406
2154,I'm just a reg joe and I also have a pair of boss and a pair of beats.... but I use these for work and I bring them home so the kids use.....,406
2155,"Once your headphones and device are connected, they're basically ready.",406
2156,"Bass is nice and clear, beat's quality without the hype and 100x price tag.",406
2157,Able to block out my surroundings and the long wires make it easy for me to move around freely.,406
2158,They give a really nice sound experience INMHO especially for being fairly inexpensive headphones.,406
2159,"However, for the price and what they are used for...perfection!",406
2160,"I didn't hear the noise while doing the eliptical machine at the club, only when running outside.",406
2161,I've worn them for over an hour at at stretch and they don't hurt my ears.,406
2162,Due to their wireless nature I believe these will be more durable than wired headphones.,406
2163,"I'd recommend KOSS Titanium cheapo's instead.. for the same basic price range they are lighter, sound much better and are more comfortable, plus have volume slider... they just don't have the full enclosure for blocking other sounds as much.",406
2164,The sound quality is very good and has good strong bass.,406
2165,great for those days when the maintenance guys are using the leafblowers.,406
2166,These are great for driving and working in the yard when you don't want to be handling your phone.,406
2167,Headphones exceeded my expectations!!!!,406
2168,I'd buy them again if I needed a replacement anytime soon!,406
2169,"(4) The head phone boasts connectivity to multiple devices at once, but never worked for me, tried using two mobile phones.",406
2170,Some final tidbits for those who care about these things.,406
2171,I've been through many bluetooth headphones and these are at the top of the list.,406
2172,freq response very good considering the low price.,406
2173,"As I mentioned, these are not the headphones that you want if you are an audiophile seeking perfect sound, heavy bass response or noise cancelling capabilities.",406
2174,I don't think they are made to be waterproof.,406
2175,"EXCEPTIONAL CLEAN SOUND, comfortable and can be worn with a bike or motorcycle helmet.",407
2176,Money well spent!,407
2177,I'm going to be replacing these headphones in a matter of days so I thought I'd give them a review.,407
2178,I use the pair they have at my office and after twenty minutes my ears hurt.,407
2179,The only feature they have is earpieces that cover the full ear canal opening to muffle external sound waves.,407
2180,"They worked fine before, but I have to say I'm very disappointed.",407
2181,I let a friend borrow those so decided to get a second pair.,407
2182,"Very pleased, especially for the price.",407
2183,love also because they are comfortable.,407
2184,Headphones exceeded my expectations!!!!,407
2185,She has multiple sclerosis and has no feeling in her arms and hands.,407
2186,Then I realized it was supposed to be put on behind the neck.,407
2187,I like to listen while cleaning house.,407
2188,"They are light and comfortable to wear, even while wearing glasses, and the pause, track-skip, volume, and phone functions work well.",407

2191,I bought these in 2013.,407
2192,The design is great.,407
2193,I love the sound these have and they are almost as good as what I had with the Walkman that I purchased almost 2 years ago.,407
2194,Pros - They are made for traveling.,407
2195,It is sleek modern looking headphones that is even comfortable to wear.,407
2196,"The headphones are light, featuring a nice, thick cable.",407
2197,I would not buy it again.,407
2198,"For example, if I put my phone in my front left pocket and walk then the connection has a tendency to break up in time to my steps.",407
2199,"I am wearing these headphones right now writing this review, and I am not even listening to music!",407
2200,"For 20 bucks, they're more than worth it.",408
2201,I have had many Sony products over the yrs and have always been impressed.,408
2202,"Now I will say that these are my first pair of headphones, but from what I can tell the are really grate!",408
2203,One of the earbuds had broken making it necessary to purchase another set.,408
2204,"We haven't opened yet as they are for a christmas present, but have purchased similar before.",408
2205,"I was really blown away when I first listened to these, because they greatly exceeded my expectations.",408
2206,"After about 7 years of heavy use, the plastic/vinyl on the ear cups is starting to peel away.",408
2207,Haven't needed to charge the battery again yet.,408
2208,They have a VERY CLEAR sound.,408
2209,I had been waiting excitedly to get this item it's cool good reviews what could go wrong?,408
2210,In fact just yesterday was the first time that it didn't but that was related to the adapter not the headphone.,408
2211,"However, for me, it's really minimal.",408
2212,"if i had the chance and some extra cash, i will eventually switch to something more comfortable that i can wear for a long period for work.",408
2213,"For the price of this set, I'd give it my approval.",408
2214,these headphones are great.,408
2215,This set delivers in all aspects and lets me listen to my music without the whole house having to listen to it as well.,408
2216,I need looking for the noise canceling headphone.,408
2217,Great product!!,408
2218,"I decided that I wanted to try a bluetooth option for my daily workouts... Let me tell you, I will not miss my annoying earbuds or the cord!",408
2219,Loud if you want them to be.,408
2220,They are very nice.,408
2221,Bass was lacking and vocals seemed muffled.,408
2222,"I have had a number of Bluetooth stereo headsets including the last version of these, and I must say these are the best for the money I have found.",408
2223,The other person could not hear me.,408
2224,overall a great purchase for a great price!,408
2225,"In hindsight, I should have stepped up the extra $13 and purchased the Koss R10.",409
2226,I'm not interested in making phone calls with those headphones.,409
2227,Just recently started to experience distortion in one of the ear pieces.,409
2228,I widely recommend the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Headphone.,409
2229,I purchased the white one for my mother and it looks classy!,409
2230,"Update - 9/16/15

After trying to use these things for a month I've given up.",409
2231,"I have used them on a run, several times at the gym and to walk my dog.",409
2232,They sound great and I love the phone feature.,409
2233,"Once I hear that beep and plug them in for charging, it takes about 2 hours for a full charge.",409
2234,People on the other end of the phone can't even tell I'm driving a truck.,409
2235,For the price and quality I'd buy them again.,409
2236,freq response very good considering the low price.,409
2237,Very comfortable headphones.,409
2238,I'm returning them and will investigate if it was just a manufacturing issue.,409
2239,Had the BTH220 for a year and they work good but don't last over 3 hrs on a charge.,409
2240,"Ask them what Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) or steady-state RMS power or MP3 compression is, and usually that's the end of the conversation.",409
2241,-The design of the cushions as well as the tension in the headband make these headphones hard to wear for more than 10 minutes.,409
2242,I don't even wear them anymore and I haven't even had them long because they were so uncomfortable.,409
2243,Able to block out my surroundings and the long wires make it easy for me to move around freely.,409
2244,The Kinivo BTH240 is my 3rd pair of bluetooth stereo headphones.,409
2245,"Besides, they are comfortable to wear.",409
2246,Great sound quality and able to move from room to room in house without loosing any sound (from end to end).,409
2247,It matches my white Sony Vaio too which is a plus.,409
2248,I would say they look better and they seemed a bit smaller around the head but overall I prefer the SoundBot's in this price range.,409
2249,I should have bought two of these.,409
2250,Ordered for my nephew.,410
2251,They work quite well with a Nook HD+ and allow me to move without being entangled in wires when I put the Nook down to do something else.,410
2252,Not suitable for running at all.,410
2253,"Boosts the bass volume compared to my macbook, but not too heavy that it's bothersome in my ears.",410
2254,"If you really care about studio type clarity, you need to at least $100 to your budget price point and look elsewhere.",410
2255,"The battery life is excellent, I've never had the battery run down on me.",410
2256,"I'm partial to over-the-ear headphones, never could get used to uncomfortable earbuds.",410
2257,I felt they were going to fall off at any moment.,410
2258,I've owned the BHT220 for years...they finally started acting up so I jumped to these.,410
2259,Then let's talk about how they make your ears sweat alot!,410
2260,I hated these headphones.,410
2261,I suppose I was expecting too much at this price range!,410
2262,I'm glad that I did.,410
2263,The product that came in the box looked alright but it was closed tight with just tape.,410
2264,I had discovered with the 220s that I had to have my phone in my right front pocket for a steady connection because the receiver for the headphones is in the right side.,410
2265,"I checked my orders and it literally had the little ""(White)"" in the name.",410
2266,Sound quality is awesome it could be louder though.,410
2267,"I originally got these headphones in black a few years back with my Zune and only after getting stepped on, did they break.",410
2268,"These are ""OK"".",410
2269,They are also very comfortable to wear.,410
2270,The range isn't too bad either.,410
2271,"Now, on a regular basis, I use these headphones for just listening to music walking down the street from my ipod.",410
2272,So the new three star rating is for the company not the headset that gets a two tops.,410
2273,Plenty loud enough for most users and insanely long battery life.,410
2274,"The same piece is used on other cheap headsets I have gotten from competing companies, so I believe it is a commodity part.",410
2275,"Bought these on: August 8, 2014.",411
2276,"Cons - Ears get a little hot with prolonged use, so I adjust them occasionnaly for a little more airflow.",411
2277,Had the BTH220 for a year and they work good but don't last over 3 hrs on a charge.,411
2278,"PROS: Perfect for any mp3 player, tablet, audio device, and computer using a 3.5mm audio jack (virtually all mainstream devices do).",411
2279,He uses them often with his iPod.,411
2280,"2) The headband does not have any padding, and this caused a little bit of discomfort for me.",411
2281,The cord is fairly large so it doesn't get tangled and it very durable.,411
2282,Even worse with glasses.,411
2283,"The same piece is used on other cheap headsets I have gotten from competing companies, so I believe it is a commodity part.",411
2284,I bought mine almost two years ago for twenty bucks and it still works so well.,411
2285,They are easy to set up.,411
2286,I was pleased that my headphones had arrived ahead of schedule.,411
2287,My only 'con' would be length of the cable.,411
2288,I recommend the vendor and the headphones.,411
2289,the sound is amazing quality is good and i loved the price you cant beat under 20 for sony headphones.,411
2290,"They are relatively durable, last about a year or so.",411
2291,I use these almost exclusively with my laptop while in my living room.,411
2292,The sound quality is great on the kinivo.,411
2293,Perfect for travelers who are looking for fewer wires to mess with while lounging at the airport.,411
2294,"The fit is comfortable, the volume doesnt get as loud as you would like but for the price it was a good investment for bluetooth since I cant stand wired headphones.",411
2295,They were really comfortable but if I wore them for more than a few hours they started to bug my ears.,411
2296,Buyers be aware!,411
2297,"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.",411
2298,"For the price, Yeh they're worth $15 but not much more.",411
2299,I only read the negative reviews so I could find out the quirks that most users found with them.,411
2300,"Of course, this wasn't strictly managed by my phone.",412
2301,The sound is great and the battery life is decent.,412
2302,"For the price, you really can't beat it!",412
2303,"They are a little bigger, but they fold up more easily and can be wound up and tossed in a bag.",412
2304,"I used to borrow the school's headphones, but I didn't like the idea of using something that hundreds of other students were using.",412
2305,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,412
2306,Low battery chime that rings every 40-60 seconds until unit is charged.,412
2307,(I must write at least two more words to meet length requirement.),412
2308,"But you can also tell L/R by touch, on the outside, just above the earcup, the Left side has a dot, while the Right side has no dots.",412
2309,But the best thing of all is the price - $25!,412
2310,Overall I wouldnt recommend this product and wish I had bought something else.,412
2311,"However, this was likely because of how use to my *awesome* Apple earbuds i was.",412
2312,These are hands down the worst sounding headphones I've ever owned.,412
2313,This headset remembers pairing with up to 5 devices.,412
2314,"I've only used them for a day, but so far they are making a good impression.",412
2315,"I am a smallish woman with a small head and small ears and there was no way to wear these comfortably, or even in a way that made them feel they would stay on my ears.",412
2316,They are hard plastic with little give.,412
2317,I am sure this is a good headset but not for what I needed it for.,412
2318,"I have tried multiple phones and eventually they all disconnect for a moment depending on whether the phone is upside down, or which pocket I have the phone in.",412
2319,This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I bought 'em because of price and the good ratings.,412
2320,I'm only glad that I ended up with black instead of the ugly green ones.,412
2321,"I have owned many Koss's, Sennheiser's, Sony's, Audio Technica's, and even some Bose.",412
2322,"If you are a hi-fi head, you'll be disappointed with some of the range issues, but for the rest of us mere mortals, they are fantastic and give a true and clear sound.",412
2323,"All other affordable headphones have only lasted me a few months, so, needless to say, I was very pleased with this pair.",412
2324,"Typically, I have my iPhone in my pocket or on the desk I'm sitting at or in the space on the treadmill where you set down your devices.",412
2325,I bought these headphones due to a review by the wirecutter and I can say that it lived up to their praise.,413
2326,And the finishing BEST feature of these is the price.,413
2327,"I like them, so I will probably continue to use them, but i wish they were more comfortable.",413
2328,Fit is fair too.,413
2329,I bought them to use at my desk at work and they are good for that.,413
2330,I recommend the vendor and the headphones.,413
2331,I find the slimmer BTH240 is more attractive and offers controls that are more user-friendly.,413
2332,"Fit, in terms of tightness on the head ( my hat size is 7 1/4 ) is a 6 on a 1 to ten scale.",413
2333,I'll update this review in a few months when they're good and burned in and I get them away from him for a bit to listen again.,413
2334,"These are simple, lightweight and sound good.",413
2335,"The ones I had were actually Sony, and more expensive than these headphones!!!!",413
2336,"If you're looking for a affordable and good quality headphone, I will recommend these headphones.",413
2337,"I purchased a pair after being impressed by my fiance's, and when he lost his, he stole mine.",413
2338,I have always felt like they made a good product for value headphones.,413
2339,The privacy of knowing that my TV viewing is not disturbing anyone.,413
2340,The biggest gripe I have with them is just how NOT loud they are.,413
2341,"Both models respond well to my phone's EQ app, letting me boost the deep bass and highest treble.",413
2342,I use them with my smartphone and if I'm watching television or listening to music all I have to do is push a button on the side to answer a call.,413
2343,"Before I bought these, I asked myself if these were really worth it, but it was worth it.",413
2344,My daughter is happy to have it as it matches with her laptop colour and look expensive too with SONY logo on the earpieces.,413
2345,"The ear cups pivot to fold flat, and fit in the shallow drawer of my media cabinet.",413
2346,I use these primarily for listening to training videos or low volume music when reading.,413
2347,Arrived earlier than expected.,413
2348,Only dislike is the way they hang on my ears and compete with my glasses.,413
2349,I've also put it in many bags when traveling where I'm sure the cords were angled in a way that should have caused fraying but the cords are fine.,413
2350,I had the older versions of this headset and they worked great and this one is no exception.,414
2351,"This is my second purchase, this time as a gift for my wife.",414
2352,"I decided that I wanted to try a bluetooth option for my daily workouts... Let me tell you, I will not miss my annoying earbuds or the cord!",414
2353,This is my third pair and I absolutely love them.,414
2354,"As for colors: I mainly don't care, but there is some small utility value in having different colors, to make it easier to keep track of which is charged or which belongs in my gymbag.",414
2355,No complaints at all.,414
2356,ADDENDUM: Just used my Kinivo BTH240 wireless headphones for the second time in the gym and I experienced A LOT of cutouts and interference this time.,414
2357,"I don't ever review, but these headphones are worth it.",414
2358,They produce crisp high's and nice bass with balanced midrange.,414
2359,"Its sturdy and can withstand abuse (tossing it onto the table, for example) and the wires are thicker than your average $5 headphones.",414
2360,I bought these before going on an eight hour road trip and wore them almost the whole way.,414
2361,I look forward to Kinivo's next model.,414
2362,"No more charge, no more factory reset.",414
2363,Im sure kinovo switched production to have cheaper production costs.,414
2364,"I've owned a lot of wired headphones, some of which were hi end.",414
2365,Happy with my purchase!,414
2366,"They may not be the best headphones out there, but they are a great deal, and still a good set of headphones.",414
2367,I've had a pair of these (white) for three years and they are still going strong.,414
2368,"I bought these for somebody else and they didn't like them, but I started using them and I use them all of the time now.",414
2369,"The cord is pretty nice, it is thick and sturdy.",414
2370,"i don't like it , because the cable is short , and it's not comfortable :( , a like the sound quality and weight , i shouldn't forget the price , for the price i think it's a nice choice .",414
2371,"The MDR-V300s also have 30mm drivers, but they have a better magnet, which I assume makes a big difference.",414
2372,Received these for my 5 year old son.,414
2373,How do they do it for that price?,414
2374,I never would of thought that 7 dollars headphones would work so well.,414
2375,Now I am stuck with some useless headphones.,415
2376,I have used it for about a month now and I love this product.,415
2377,Due to the headphones being smaller than my head I feel that the joints of these three pieces that make up the headband are going to snap on me as they do not feel durable.,415
2378,"Decent pair of headphones, especially when you consider the price.",415
2379,The second pair came in the mail worked great for a week.,415
2380,So I am a regular gym goer and I use my headphone while working out.,415
2381,my 5th generation apple headphones actually sound better then these!,415
2382,They are painful if you wear them very long.,415
2383,A little staticky when touched by where you plug the cord in to your device.,415
2384,"If you want fashion, buy beats, if you want function, buy sony.",415
2385,"I bought the new one because I lost the other ones again, and I wanted a separate pair for work.",415
2386,"After four years and no small amount of wear to the pads, these phones still sound as crystal clear as when I bought them.",415
2387,Sounds are well reproduced with full bass and high trebles.,415
2388,The fit isn't quite as snug as I'd like and the headphones tend to move around slightly while jogging.,415
2389,They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these).,415
2390,I am happy the ear pieces turn for storage.,415
2391,IF this is product is an indication they are back.,415
2392,Only item I didn't like was that the headstrap is not adjustable.,415
2393,"There is sound when plugged into my phone, but even with adapters purchased at a local electronic store, I have not been able to get them to work with my computer or TV.",415
2394,Your guess is as good as mine!,415
2395,The power switch failed mechanically.,415
2396,I would buy again.,415
2397,Bought these for my son for Christmas.,415
2398,I was too lazy to return it which was my second mistake.,415
2399,The build quality on this pair is much higher however.,415
2400,I bought these for an auditory discrimination program for my son's therapy.,416
2401,"If activated once to open up voice calling on my smartphone it works wonderfully, but the headset refuses to perform the action again and provides a low-pitch beep that does little more than annoy.",416
2402,Can't believe they were as inexpensive as they were.,416
2403,"The customer service for this product is outstanding and do the right job to get the job
done in time.",416
2404,The chord isn't even compromised.,416
2405,In case your wondering in those three years the sound is the same (This time I bough the Black Colored Version) so there is no downgrade in the quality that at times happens.,416
2406,"On the other hand, they sound great and are at a fantastic price point.",416
2407,You will not get any appreciably better audio quality with more expensive headphones like Beats for 100s of dollars more.,416
2408,"The sound is good and it works as it should, but it's a bit tight over the ears and it's a bit uncomfortable when wearing sunglasses since both would rest over your ear.",416
2409,Sony's MDR-ZX100's are amazing.,416
2410,It is a great set of headphones for the price.,416
2411,great headphones in my opinion better than beats but leak alot of sound and they fit well i have an afro and they are big enough to go over that so they please me and they handle bass well,416
2412,(they sounded a lot better) I went back online to find a pair of the rocketfish.,416
2413,"There is a soft feel to these headphones that integrate with the body, on the head and too in perception of sound that just feels natural, ergonomic in the highest sense of that term, again in relation to the price.",416
2414,"He says the sound is far superior in these than what we have in the bedroom, which at the time of purchase was the gold standard of wireless headphones.",416
2415,These could be really awesome but they just won't stay put.,416
2416,No issues here.,416
2417,I would buy again.,416
2418,The sound-quality when wearing them is clear and even works with bass-heavy* songs.,416
2419,These came to me broken and I think that stands as a testament to the poor build quality on these headphones.,416
2420,There is no padding on them.,416
2421,Wears comfortably for 4 hour long online classes.,416
2422,Would most definitely buy another pair of these!,416
2423,I've had my pair for almost 4 years.,416
2424,"I purchased high end pair, the ear pad connector broke conveniently a week after warranty ran out.",416
2425,No deep bass like Bose but good dynamic sound & switching to phone calls is seamless.,417
2426,I have a small head for a guy and these are just big enough.,417
2427,It is does not have noise reduction but since it is cheap it is worth it.,417
2428,"Update - 9/16/15

After trying to use these things for a month I've given up.",417
2429,"If you have prominent ridges on your ears and normal head phones bother you, don't buy these because it will be just as bad if not worse.",417
2430,The putting on the side work excellent even allowing you to talk to Siri without ever touching your phone.,417
2431,ADDENDUM: Just used my Kinivo BTH240 wireless headphones for the second time in the gym and I experienced A LOT of cutouts and interference this time.,417
2432,"On the left side in particular, the wire pressed against the top of my ear making it a little sore after long use.",417
2433,I'm not sure exactly how far it is ... maybe 60-75 feet or so ... far enough to be able to get a drink or go grab some equipment without having to move my phone.,417
2434,The sound quality is great on the kinivo.,417
2435,"They don't like the earbuds and all the other (besides ""BEATS"") headphones kept falling apart.",417
2436,Great headphones.,417
2437,Great price for a pretty ok sound.,417
2438,"I would NEVER buy the Beats for two hundred dollars, these work just fine.",417
2439,they fold up and fit nicely in his backpack.,417
2440,I could only hear through one side.,417
2441,I find the ear piece to be very comfortable.,417
2442,I use these pretty regularly and have had them for about a year.,417
2443,Bought these for my wife.,417
2444,"These wouldn't pair with my Girlfriend's iPhone or iPad, My iPhone or iPad.",417
2445,"I try 2wk s ago and love it but the draw back is the stereo sound quality, kind a not so loud to hear the music in a noisy work place.",417
2446,The sound quality feedback for talking is very poor.,417
2447,Great sound for the price.,417
2448,"However, AMAZON returned for me hassle free.",417
2449,"The headset has operating controls on the right headphone, on-off, volume, mode/multifunction button and next or repeat selection.",417
2450,It came with everything the back had listed on it and the jack was wrapped perfectly which gave me the impression that they weren't even plugged in.,418
2451,It was with reservation that I tried this one from Kinivo.,418
2452,Cord is decent as it should be but top is very cheap plastic.,418
2453,"The headset has operating controls on the right headphone, on-off, volume, mode/multifunction button and next or repeat selection.",418
2454,"Bought this to replace an older model BTH240 (which was great), but this one is slow to connect, frequently drops out or outright disconnects.",418
2455,These sound good and they don't distort when I set a high volume.,418
2456,I was a bit apprehensive before because I had never heard of the brand Kinivo.,418
2457,"During a workout, my music will gradually lower to min volume and then start beeping (because it hit the volume min limit).",418
2458,"They offer a lot of volume, great when walking, running, working around the house or mowing the yard.",418
2459,They sit comfortably on my head and I like the little red bar which identifies the right side.,418
2460,Normally cheap headphones are tinny and junky sounding but these really sound good.,418
2461,Now I just recieved the BTH240 and it is 2.1+EDR same as the older version.,418
2462,They fit  a little tight at first but I got used to them.,418
2463,"On the other hand, they sound great and are at a fantastic price point.",418
2464,Also style is beautiful.,418
2465,These are the best On-Ear headphones that I have ever used.,418
2466,These head phone are still over the ear.,418
2467,I'm not interested in making phone calls with those headphones.,418
2468,Bought this a month and it was working well until today .,418
2469,"I use them at work, at the gym.",418
2470,They stay in place while doing any excersise from pullups to situps.,418
2471,This unit would be fine for somebody with a narrow head or a child but normal sized people should buy something else.,418
2472,"Over the years, the cushion that rests on your years has turned into flakes so now I have the sponge material left over.",418
2473,They feel as equally comfortable around your neck as in your head.,418
2474,This slight adjustment in design makes the control of the headphone much easier and more useful.,418
2475,Nice little headphones.,419
2476,"But actually, it is not!",419
2477,This set delivers in all aspects and lets me listen to my music without the whole house having to listen to it as well.,419
2478,Great little fella.,419
2479,"Secondly, the ear cups don't swivel nearly as much as the older ones did, which makes it difficult to place them on your head.",419
2480,"Anyway, these work really well and seem like they would last a long time--if you keep them out of your mouth.",419
2481,Very dissapointing!,419
2482,If anything ever happens to them we will definitely be repurchasing!,419
2483,Even just walking around the neighborhood is OK as they cut back on traffic noise.,419
2484,This is a great product!!!,419
2485,one word amazing!!,419
2486,"The connection to my phone is great, so I can have it in my bag instead of a pocket like with a wired set.",419
2487,The midranges and the highs serve to add dimension and overall they are biased pretty well.,419
2488,I go through headphones very quickly (three or four pairs in the last year).,419
2489,So that means they still need to improve the microphones on the stereo headsets.,419
2490,My teenage son uses them constantly and hasn't had any problems.,419
2491,"Now he can walk around the room, listening to music, while his iPod is charging.",419
2492,I'm still contemplating reordering because I do like them.,419
2493,These headphones have good sound and nice quality for the price.,419
2494,I just wish they included a carrying case so i could just throw it in my backpack.,419
2495,"Very pleased, especially for the price.",419
2496,"My main issue is that they keep cutting out, like multiple times in the length of a single song.",419
2497,The head size is decent (I have a big head and it fits over my head comfortably).,419
2498,I wear a 7.5 hat and these don't fit me well.,419
2499,"I thought these were going to be good quality sound, but their worst then walmart $5 headphones.",419
2500,The headphone jack is really sensitive and you will be fighting with it.. twisting it so the sound doesnt go away.,420
2501,"I've had them for over two hours, listening to Alpha/ BiNatural beats while reading.",420
2502,"My only complaint is that they're not that great at blocking out external noises - on a crowded bus or subway, I have to turn up my volume almost all the way to hear my music properly.",420
2503,I've been through many bluetooth headphones and these are at the top of the list.,420
2504,These probably aren't really good for music.,420
2505,They were really comfortable but if I wore them for more than a few hours they started to bug my ears.,420
2506,Quality build you'd expect from Sony as well as quality sound.,420
2507,I paid $12 for these and they are great.,420
2508,Excellent value!,420
2509,They don't hug my head too tightly (where I might get a headache).,420
2510,"That, combined with a great many calls where the headset abruptly dropped connectivity with a loud ""PANG!""",420
2511,For the past 12 years I've always bought LabTec 820's but since they've stop making those I had to resort to these headphones.,420
2512,"They also cancel other sound remarkable well, almost dangerously so if they were worn outside running!",420
2513,"They are not what I expected, but they're great for the price.",420
2514,"The ear cups pivot to fold flat, and fit in the shallow drawer of my media cabinet.",420
2515,Gone are the days you can buy a well made pair of headphones or ear-buds for a decent price that will last.,420
2516,"The sound quality and the bass is very impressive, I might even purchase another one for a family member.",420
2517,"I get a crazy long range, maybe about 100-150 feet from one end of the plant to the trailer bay.",420
2518,"I would try and ""return"" it but it says you can only return an UNOPENED item.",420
2519,"Since these headphones are placed on the back of neck, it is hard to tell you whether they are going to fit you.",420
2520,No bass and no highs at all - even I could immediately tell that!!!,420
2521,"These headphones do go quite loud, but when you crank them up, they are very bass heavy.",420
2522,I would highly recommend these headphones without any reservations.,420
2523,Price comparable to lesser models seen at Wal-Mart and the like.,420
2524,Excellent sound quality.,420
2525,No bass and no highs at all - even I could immediately tell that!!!,421
2526,People on the other end of the phone can't even tell I'm driving a truck.,421
2527,The wires are great because of being flatter they are more able to bend without stressing the connection to the headphones themselves.,421
2528,They are NOT noise cancelling by any means but it's definitely a bonus.,421
2529,Affordable too!,421
2530,The other loses connection often as it tries to connect to every device at once.,421
2531,Before I won new headphones I use these ones all the time.,421
2532,They stay put without issue.,421
2533,The poorly designed bass response was also taken into consideration.,421
2534,"Not the most expensive, but decent enough to listen to music with no issues.",421
2535,I was nervous about the volume being too low since everyone was talking about noise cancelation type stuff but I use them and can't hear a thing besides my music and that's all I could ask for!!,421
2536,*Comfortable Secure Fit.,421
2537,"Pros:
> The speakers can swivel and rest flat.",421
2538,"This is an Awsome wireless BlueTooth headset, especially for the bargain price.",421
2539,Don't fall off durning workout or jog.,421
2540,"Well, I think that because the headphone jack on my custom computer build is quite tight, it causes a spacer to break off.",421
2541,"Anyway I was looking for the dj style that covers the ears and provide at least some noise reduction, for under 20 doll-hairs.",421
2542,the 'ear pads' are really comfortable even when wearing them for a few hours.,421
2543,"One problem is they are a little small, and hurt your ears after a while.",421
2544,Until one side of the headphones stopped working.,421
2545,Low battery chime that rings every 40-60 seconds until unit is charged.,421
2546,"While I haven't used a measuring tape, I can easily walk around my entire fitness facility and never lose connection.",421
2547,"When sitting down and my phone resting on the table, I've never experienced any inconsistencies.",421
2548,I have been very happy up until now.,421
2549,"Even though these $20 headphones aren't it the same league as those, they are amazing for the price point.",421
2550,"The arrangement with the microphone on the headset can work (on other brands), but it is not working well on this one.",422
2551,"There is that rattle when jostled (say, during a run/jog) that others have posted.",422
2552,I kept getting the cord of the cable wrapped around my chair or hooked on something.,422
2553,"Most importantly though, the price point is great and I can run, lift weights, and shoot hoops in these just fine.",422
2554,"I have tried multiple phones and eventually they all disconnect for a moment depending on whether the phone is upside down, or which pocket I have the phone in.",422
2555,They are great for the price if you just want to have a way to monitor things without bothering others.,422
2556,It's bass heavy (which I like) and clear.,422
2557,"For the price, you can't beat these headphones.",422
2558,I am very disappointed now though.,422
2559,"These are really affordable headphones, nice and loud with decent bass.",422
2560,Such a good buy.,422
2561,I'll use them 5-8hrs a week then charge them.,422
2562,I'm sure others like this option but it does not fit my needs.,422
2563,The headphone jack is really sensitive and you will be fighting with it.. twisting it so the sound doesnt go away.,422
2564,"I revised my review to 4 stars, would be 5 if the microphone worked better.",422
2565,I would recommend it to everyone I meet.,422
2566,"I gave them 5 stars because at this price, you WILL NOT find headphones that sound better.",422
2567,I love the sound these have and they are almost as good as what I had with the Walkman that I purchased almost 2 years ago.,422
2568,"While they aren't advertised as sweat proof, I have sweated out buckets with these on and have had no effect on usage!",422
2569,My last pair were with me for daily use for almost 4 years and only had to be replaced when my cat helpfully chewed through the cord.,422
2570,"the headphones (on ear)
2.)",422
2571,"Only ""problem"" is the plastic part that goes over your head doesn't bend much so it looks a little funny when you wear them, but not a big deal at all.",422
2572,Headphones will not pair with my computer.,422
2573,Had them for only about a few weeks and they are busted....just buy something else.,422
2574,These headphones were recommended to me by a colleague.,422
2575,I love the headphones.,423
2576,This headset remembers pairing with up to 5 devices.,423
2577,Bought these for my kids in school and I didn't want to spend a lot for school supplies.,423
2578,I'm totally used to them now.,423
2579,Sound isn't high enough and there's NO BASS at all.,423
2580,"There is that rattle when jostled (say, during a run/jog) that others have posted.",423
2581,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,423
2582,These are great for working out and stay snug on your ears.,423
2583,The battery life is great and easily lasts a full 8 hour day at work.,423
2584,Tried these in a store that is why I bought them.,423
2585,A co-worker had these and so I decided to give them a try.,423
2586,I have to reconnect it at least 10 times a day.,423
2587,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,423
2588,These headphones are actually a lot better than I was expecting.,423
2589,"Quality of the voice calls - not sure about that, but people hear me.",423
2590,He thought he'd never find one like it.,423
2591,They are durable and sound great.,423
2592,I am very satisfied and encourage you to buy this headset.,423
2593,"But, with the price set on this level!",423
2594,"I've owned a lot of wired headphones, some of which were hi end.",423
2595,No bass and no highs at all - even I could immediately tell that!!!,423
2596,These are not bad headphones for the price.,423
2597,"if i had the chance and some extra cash, i will eventually switch to something more comfortable that i can wear for a long period for work.",423
2598,The Sony MDRZX100/BLK Headphones work and sound great.,423
2599,"I do turn them off when I'm not using them, instead of leaving them in stand-by, so that might have something to do with it.",423
2600,Why wouldnt you buy these they are perfect for jogging or taking to school to and plug into your laptop.,424
2601,I read a bunch of reviews on the headphones and decided to give it a try.they work so well and cancel out noise unless you take it off.,424
2602,Other than that one small thing so far all is great they wear good and sound good!,424
2603,For the price i paid i was actually not expecting the quality that came out of the speaker.,424
2604,Thank you Kinivo for headphones that don't require charging after a few hours.,424
2605,"I have a large head, and it fits me really well.",424
2606,I mention them only because they are on my wishlist.,424
2607,Then I realized it was supposed to be put on behind the neck.,424
2608,"If you are looking for reasonably priced good quality sound, buy these.",424
2609,"It keeps cutting out, or warbling distortedly.",424
2610,Cannot get the headphones to pair with any bluetooth items.,424
2611,"I'm not sure whether if the sound had to do with the apple products, but both the Sony headphones, and my old generic $10.00  store bought headphones produced the same sound.",424
2612,"Overall, I'm happy with them, particularly at the $15.99 price point.",424
2613,For the money...they work well.,424
2614,"When using to talk on a phone call, they have great clarity and work very well.",424
2615,Kids can be turds.,424
2616,"Comfortable, small, lightweight and unobtrusive.",424
2617,"Pros: comfortable fit, relatively lightweight for being larger headphones, great sound quality, easy to wear and easy to use; noise canceling ""enough"" for the price!",424
2618,It's a little annoying.,424
2619,We've gone through a couple of pair but that's due more to misuse on her part.,424
2620,"I told him i had got these Sony headphones your tablet, when plugged the headphones into his tablet  only 1 speaker would sound  (the left side only).",424
2621,The headset works as I expected.,424
2622,Drowns out the crazies on my morning bus commute.,424
2623,I was using wired headphones that didn't have a mic so I feel safer being out in the pre-dawn knowing I can call out at the press of a button on my headset.,424
2624,They swivel so that it can lay 'flat' but do not 'fold' up into a tidy little bundle as do my Wonderful Air-Fi's (I'm spoiled).,424
2625,"After touching and using the product Kinivo, Arctic, Soundbot ranging from $20 - $36 are going to be about the same quality in sound.",425
2626,I bought these so that my partner did not have to listen to my music.,425
2627,Works great to talk through as well.,425
2628,I feel like I got an incredible bargain for the price with this product.,425
2629,"I really like the red color in the right side, that makes it look nice.",425
2630,I guess since they cover the ears they really block out a decent amount of outside noise leaving just music.,425
2631,"For $15, these are probably some of the best sounding headphones you can buy.",425
2632,"He says the sound is far superior in these than what we have in the bedroom, which at the time of purchase was the gold standard of wireless headphones.",425
2633,And I that goes for the two pair that I bought so I know that it wasn't just a lemon that I got.,425
2634,Just like other people saying the cord should be at least 6 inch longer.,425
2635,"Panasonic RP-HT21, no question, every single time.",425
2636,The sound quality is biased towards the bass side of neutral which is not my preference - but we are discussing $14.00 phones!,425
2637,I've had mine for years and they still work.,425
2638,"The ""Red"" band on the right side, denotes which ear which is good since it's very hard to read the symbols telling you otherwise.",425
2639,"Pros:
-Well built
-Good price

Cons:
-Wire randomly twists after normal use

the wires twist into themselves after using them for only a few days.",425
2640,Will people find something about them to complain about...Yes.,425
2641,love also because they are comfortable.,425
2642,"I had high hopes, but this just didn't get me there.",425
2643,I've worn them for over an hour at at stretch and they don't hurt my ears.,425
2644,"I traveled with these, stuffing them in the most obscure places.",425
2645,I would have returned it but due to my own fault I purchased them and didn't open the box until after the return window was closed.,425
2646,Sound isn't high enough and there's NO BASS at all.,425
2647,great value for stereo bluetooth headset.,425
2648,Could just be my particular unit but other than that I'm really satisfied with my purchase.,425
2649,"Under $20 though, I'm not complaining.",425
2650,It's a lifesaver!,426
2651,My head isn't too big.,426
2652,"This is my 2nd pair, the sound quality, comfort, and overall feel is just second to none for the very affordable price.",426
2653,I have issues with headphones and I seem to go through a lot of them but I've had these for several months now and they are really perfect to me.,426
2654,"Typically, I have my iPhone in my pocket or on the desk I'm sitting at or in the space on the treadmill where you set down your devices.",426
2655,Quality Headphones for the money.,426
2656,Great for the price and I will likely purchase them again when my son loses or breaks these.,426
2657,The ear cups are a little small for me.,426
2658,But I'll survive.,426
2659,"There is sound when plugged into my phone, but even with adapters purchased at a local electronic store, I have not been able to get them to work with my computer or TV.",426
2660,The fit is comfortable as well and do not feel like they are putting your skull in a vise yet there is no danger of them falling off.,426
2661,They pair nicely and hold a connection with no problem.,426
2662,"There is no tone definition, very muddy sounding.",426
2663,"I'm not sure if they will be durable just thrown in a bag, I think I'll have to be careful with them...",426
2664,They also lay flay which is nice for travel.,426
2665,But I knew this had to be just a bad unit.,426
2666,I would personally recommend these headphones.,426
2667,This is a great pair of headphones.,426
2668,"I liked the first one while it worked, then ordered two more when the first set stopped working suddenly.",426
2669,I've worn them for over an hour at at stretch and they don't hurt my ears.,426
2670,My previous experience with bluetooth devices seemed to have a larger range than that.,426
2671,"I Google headphones, asked friends for their opinions, YouTubed  videos and ultimately decided to give these a shot.",426
2672,They were tested out with 2 iPhone 5s and the new iPad w/retina display & a Dell laptop.,426
2673,I can keep alert of what happening around me.,426
2674,"But anyway, SO worth $20.",426
2675,This is a great product!!!,427
2676,It is compatible with Apple products.,427
2677,"I would have easily paid double for these headphones, and still given them 5 stars.",427
2678,"Please, do not blame the messenger.",427
2679,Connected easily to my iPhone and iPad and they block out most of the outside noise.,427
2680,"It was reasonably comfortable and the sound was surprisingly good, but the volume was uneven, the left side was noticeably quieter than the right.",427
2681,I bought 2 more after I bought the first one.,427
2682,I work in a lab and have to move around a lot while working so getting rid of cables was my highest priority followed closely by battery life.,427
2683,"Bottom line, music playback is excellent.",427
2684,You simply can't go wrong with a Sony product.,427
2685,"If it does, nothing tape can't fix.",427
2686,"They're not high end headphones by any means, but they sound great for the price and they don't seem to randomly stop working after 8 months like other low price headphones do.",427
2687,This headset is equal to a much higher priced set.,427

2706,"On the calls I've tried, it works just fine.",428
2707,-The design of the cushions as well as the tension in the headband make these headphones hard to wear for more than 10 minutes.,428
2708,They are also very comfortable to wear.,428

2737,"Other reviews on the newer 240 mentioned that the bar is closer to the head, so I thought this problem with the 220 would be lessened.",429
2738,The sound is decent nothing to heavy as far as bass which is fine because the noise cancellation makes up for some of the downsides.,429
2739,Also syncing took a great deal of attempts and time to work.,429
2740,They are very light and compact as well.,429
2741,"I had tried a couple other pair and always ran into the same problem, they were so uncomfortable that I couldn't wear them for more than 5 minutes without wanting to throw them across the room.",429

2964,The sound quality is outstanding as well.,438
2965,"So I can hear cars coming, but it doesn't interfere with my music.",438
2966,Battery life is good for workouts.,438
2967,Tried another brand but they weren't as nice as these by a long shot.,438
2968,"My son has autism so he is super picky about products he uses, and he really likes this one.. Super fast shipping!",438
2969,Before I won new headphones I use these ones all the time.,438
2970,"However, the time has come to replace them.",438
2971,Cheap and effective.,438
2972,Reasonably comfortable and pretty good sound.,438
2973,The battery life is great and easily lasts a full 8 hour day at work.,438
2974,These are great headphones.,438
2975,The video here is a video from my channel on YouTube -- ONOTech.,439
2976,"However, if you can spend a little bit more, I would suggest spending 100-200$ for a much punchier and clearer sound.",439
2977,I am using them with my Nexus 5 and Macbook to listen to music.,439
2978,"they are light weight and confortable, but i wish the cord was a little more longer since i use them in the computer at work and is kinda hard to move around with shoert cord...",439
2979,"I've only had them for a couple of weeks and only have one small complaint, while running, I have the volume down to a lower level, I can hear one of the buttons rattle.",439
2980,The first problem I noticed is the sound quality.,439
2981,I just wanted to get rid of the cord with traditional headphones because its always in my way when working out.,439
2982,These seem to have some static and a distinct lack of bass.,439
2983,It use this as my main set but they are good value.,439
2984,Received these for my 5 year old son.,439
2985,The headband is way too rigid and totally uncomfortable.,439
2986,"It's light weight, portable, comfortable, low profile easy to use and rugged.",439
2987,These are perfect for the price.,439
2988,Rugged and not heavy.,439
2989,"im not sure if its because i listen to them to loud or something else, but i tried not to listen to them that loud.",439
2990,I still hate using them.,439
2991,Fortunately I still had my old ear buds so was able to make it through the movie.,439
2992,Perfect for starter headphones before you spend hundreds on others.,439
2993,"They are super comfortable, I can wear them for hours and hours and not even notice them.",439
2994,"I thought these were going to be good quality sound, but their worst then walmart $5 headphones.",439
2995,"Really comfort, may be too comfort.",439
2996,"For this reason, I will eventually be buying new headphones... at least these were cheap.",439
2997,"I owned a similar pair of Sony headphones about ten years ago, and for the price there is no better pair that you can get.",439
2998,MY SON IS 10 AND I WOULDN'T DARE SPEND WHAT BEATS COST FOR HIM YET!!!!,439
2999,If you get these paired with your computer or phone you will enjoy these and LOVE the price.,439
3000,That alone is worth 5-stars.,440
3001,Had these about 3 years and they are still working.,440
3002,They came in great condition I really like them.,440
3003,Build quality is nice as well; sturdy plastic.,440
3004,Happy with the price point and glad I purchased them.,440
3005,I would recommend byting this with such price.,440
3006,"Ears eventually start hurting from wearing too long
3.",440
3007,Connection gets disturbed occationally but nothing to really complain about.,440
3008,Even after sweat they work great.,440
3009,"The last pair lasted two weeks, but that was partly due to his best friend.",440
3010,They're just not for me.,440
3011,They sit comfortably on my head and I like the little red bar which identifies the right side.,440
3012,I'm not interested in making phone calls with those headphones.,440
3013,I highly recommend!,440
3014,There is no clarity.,440
3015,"Bottom line, music playback is excellent.",440
3016,"While not a Bose or those other HD headphones for the price range, I don't think you'll see much better value.",440
3017,These are great by any standard.,440
3018,I gave these only 4 stars simply because I don't have any high-end sets to compare them with.,440
3019,"Cords are honestly the way to go, these cheap pos will only frustrate you.",440
3020,Now the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone I have are worthless.,440
3021,Does not drop signal continuously.,440
3022,It was worth it to pay a little extra.,440
3023,I felt they were going to fall off at any moment.,440
3024,Item shipped and was delivered quickly.,440
3025,I also wear hearing aids and these work great and are comfortable over them.,441
3026,I have had mine for about two years and they are in perfect quality.,441
3027,Highly recommend to those who have budget around 15-20 bucks.,441
3028,"I use both BOSE at home, and this product when I travel.",441
3029,"I didn't expect much for under $20, but if you consider yourself even slightly more concerned with quality than the average user, I'd get something else.",441
3030,These look and feel nice for the price.,441
3031,"I do experience some extra noise even with corded head phones, my computer may be evil.",441
3032,"They are extremely loud, which is great in a way because you know the button is actually pressed, but at the same time, isn't very appealing when you're listening to something at a low volume or have overly sensitive ears.",441
3033,"Up to now it works fine, no music ""skipped"" at all.",441
3034,I am happy with the purchase overall and would recommend them -- just to someone with a bigger head or bigger ears.,441
3035,One extra star because of the reasonable price.,441
3036,"I could probably talk anyone out of the SoundBot and Sonys, but the last two are neck and neck (no pun intended).",441
3037,"For the price, great deal.",441
3038,The sound quality in these headphones is excellent.,441
3039,But these are wonders.,441
3040,I have purchased two sets of these for my daughter.,441
3041,"Even if these broke, I would probably invest in a second pair.",441
3042,The service from the vendor was excellent.,441
3043,Some customers had hard time to fit it.,441
3044,"Actually pretty comfortable, which I was worried about with my larger-sized (7 3/8-7 1/2 hat size) noggin.",441
3045,Cops have showed up at my house to verify if everything is okay.,441
3046,I bought these headphones because I needed something for my digital media class and I didn't want to spend a fortune.,441
3047,I just got these in the mail.,441
3048,2) The rubber door that covers the USB port is flimsy and fragile and won't stay closed.,441
3049,My old ones had a longer cord but for the price they are still very good.,441
3050,The  red light was on while plugged in.,442
3051,I used it all of 3 times and then they broke.,442
3052,I suppose this thing is good for rock or rap...when deep bass pounding is wanted.,442
3053,I love these things.,442
3054,They deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum.,442
3055,"They sent out a replacement BTH240 immediately, but I had the same problem with it.",442
3056,"The ones I had were actually Sony, and more expensive than these headphones!!!!",442
3057,i put these headphones through a lot of crap.,442
3058,15% Discount gets you 1000 sales.,442
3059,"If you live by yourself or will be using these in a quiet room, they should be fine.",442
3060,1 star for the product.,442
3061,"They either don't fit my ears right, pop out, or short out.",442
3062,I find the ear piece to be very comfortable.,442
3063,"These headphones do go quite loud, but when you crank them up, they are very bass heavy.",442
3064,Now I keep a pair in my office and my new pair are my daily new daily drivers.,442
3065,I'm sure others like this option but it does not fit my needs.,442
3066,"However, the earphone material broke away and it felt uncomfortable to use.",442
3067,"Well, I think that because the headphone jack on my custom computer build is quite tight, it causes a spacer to break off.",442
3068,"Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones.",442
3069,They are very easy to pair with an iPad so that I can listen to iTunes or Spotify through my iPad without disturbing my wife.,442
3070,but they cannot be comfortably worn around the neck as these can.,442
3071,He is constantly taking phone calls as well.,442
3072,My only complaint is with the fit.,442
3073,"BTW, the 220's will still hold a charge perfectly.",442
3074,"So... my current earbuds NOW are a pair of Sharp earbuds, that came with an old cell phone, and are intended for phone use.",442
3075,Good quality and the great design help at a good price helped me enjoy them and use them as frequently as possible.,443
3076,"Also, these are not overly huge like other over ear headphones and since they cuff around your ears toward the back of your lower neck area, it doesn't get in the way of weight training.",443
3077,"So I sleep in these things, I stand up forgetting their on and yank the cord hard.. it gets stepped on sat on twisted... water all over them.",443
3078,"I have only had this for about a week and have not used it for music, so I cant speak to that.",443
3079,These headphones have a great noise isolation and you just can't hear much else but your music.,443
3080,Use them mostly for listening to music.,443
3081,The control buttons work smoothly and my iPhone 6 connected immediately and the calls are easy to answer and crystal clear.,443
3082,You won't find this quality for that cheap at your local Wal-Mart.,443
3083,1 star for the product.,443
3084,He states that the quality of sound is very good coming from the headphones and I tried them as well and I actually like them a lot better than my J Lab in ear headphones.,443
3085,"They work great, are light, and pair quickly with my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 tablets.",443
3086,"The chord was a bit shorter than I would prefer, but other than that it's fine.",443
3087,"Only ""problem"" is the plastic part that goes over your head doesn't bend much so it looks a little funny when you wear them, but not a big deal at all.",443
3088,I bought this headset to use with my Samsung Tablet.,443
3089,"Nice sound, nice fit, easy to use--what more can one want?",443
3090,Low price available at Amazon.com only.,443
3091,"Don't expect what you might hear from 200-300 dollar headphones, but these are well worth the money!",443
3092,"I Google headphones, asked friends for their opinions, YouTubed  videos and ultimately decided to give these a shot.",443
3093,Spend a little more and buy something better.,443
3094,"Although they are mainly plastic, they are quite durable as I've used them virtually everyday since I purchased them in January of this year.",443
3095,Can't beat the price and quality!,443
3096,The price was nice ($25) they arrived the next day and I started using them immediately.,443
3097,Fortunately I still had my old ear buds so was able to make it through the movie.,443
3098,Sound isn't high enough and there's NO BASS at all.,443
3099,"They are comfortable, block out outside noise, and have good audio quality.",443
3100,They are moderately comfortable but I would not wear them for more than an hour or so.,444
3101,"Clear sound, no punching bass like the XB series but still good enough to sound good on a rap track.",444
3102,"I had high hopes, but this just didn't get me there.",444
3103,Two best features are the exceptional sound quality and very long battery life.,444
3104,These give me the ability to move around and continue my life while she does that.,444
3105,"I'm considering the price range, I did not expect it to sound as good as a sennheiser but still it was a bit disappointing",444
3106,"As you can gather from the title of this review, the product does not cancel noise.",444
3107,"not much power under the hood coming from an ipod touch 4, and it isn't comfortable like anything you spend big bucks for.",444
3108,I thank the many other users for the great reviews that brought me to this purchase.,444
3109,I use my phone for listening to music or audiobooks while driving and watching movies or my droidtv when I'm not.,444
3110,"2014 CHristo as my Grandma purchased these head phones for me, they were great till late November of this year.",444
3111,They fold up so nicely and fit in my bag to take anywhere I go.,444
3112,I would even pay for it because without it they are useless.,444
3113,They get fairly loud and Don't distort at high volume.,444
3114,"If you live by yourself or will be using these in a quiet room, they should be fine.",444
3115,"These are exactly what I needed, and way better than what I thought I'd get.",444
3116,They fit so comfortably and nicely!,444
3117,"After a day...
PROs: Comfortable headset (sure beats ear buds), good sound quality, easy to set up.",444
3118,"These headphones are built by amazingly, talented, under-aged Chinese slave children.",444
3119,"I think if a person wants an average, inexpensive set set of headphones it would be hard to go wrong with these.",444
3120,"The first set I use with my computer in the office, the second I use with my tablet at home so I can watch Netflix while my wife is watching television.",444
3121,"But as they are, I cannot recommend them.",444
3122,"I have an older version of these headphones at home that still work well, but wanted another set for work.",444
3123,Highly recommended.,444
3124,I have an app on my phone with an equalizer and played around with the sound settings.,444
3125,I really like it for listening functions.,445
3126,I guess you get what you pay for.,445
3127,"For $15, these are probably some of the best sounding headphones you can buy.",445
3128,"Love that fact you can actually skip songs on itunes and Pandora, something units couldn't do a few years back.",445
3129,These headphones were inexpensive and arrived fairly quickly.,445
3130,The first set had the speaks go out and the same thing happened to the second set.,445
3131,Other than that they fit good around my ears and drown out other sounds'.,445
3132,i complain alot about how the headphones i buy are too cheap and don't really work.,445
3133,Packaged well and arrived quickly!,445
3134,I like the thick cord.,445
3135,Don't think it's possible to find anything better for this price.,445
3136,"Comfortable, small, lightweight and unobtrusive.",445
3137,"I was going to send them back, but my husband (who does not have any type of TMJ or jaw ache issues) decided to keep them as jogging headphones.",445
3138,These are the best On-Ear headphones that I have ever used.,445
3139,We have bought several versions of these headphones.,445
3140,These look and feel nice for the price.,445
3141,The poorly designed bass response was also taken into consideration.,445
3142,This makes the headset unstable and renders the unit useless.,445
3143,if you are in the market for an inexpensive bluetooth headset these are for you.,445
3144,Instructions are clearly written and the battery last a long time.,445
3145,"These are really affordable headphones, nice and loud with decent bass.",445
3146,I have had mine for about two years and they are in perfect quality.,445
3147,"Great product here, Kinivo!",445
3148,There was some disconnection when using this outside while shooting hoops.,445
3149,I used to be able to wear a hood with the V150s but the ZX100 are much wider and a hood just looks absurd pulled over them.,445
3150,"When pulling the plug from the headphone jack, i have to pinch the rubber casing to prevent it from pulling apart further.",446
3151,"Sounds beautifully, but the cord is just too short.",446
3152,I like the fact that I can lay the ear muff flat so I can just slip it my computer case.,446
3153,"I use them on my bike trainer so I can watch TV without having to turn the volume up to 100, and I don't have to adjust them every 5 seconds.",446
3154,"Cons:
- not adjustable.",446
3155,Good set of headphones for the price.,446
3156,Here's a hint: EQ them.,446
3157,I purchased the Artic P311 and Kinivo BTH204 together.,446
3158,"Sometimes I can keep a connection on the opposite side of my house from my iPhone 4S (yes, I know it's dated, but come on!).",446
3159,"But, as the title of my review stated, for a set of headphones under 20 bucks I did not expect them to be equivocal to 150 dollar headphones.",446
3160,"If you're looking for a solid set of 'phones at a low price, you simply can't do better than this.",446
3161,"The way they wrap around the back of the neck makes it difficult to wear them while lying down or reclining, e.g.",446
3162,"Not too flexible, so wide heads may have difficulty.",446
3163,I have been using these for months at work everyday for 8 hours.,446
3164,I can't use them if I am trying to work on stuff beside my computer.,446
3165,"Of course they do not get as good sound as my Beats by Dr. Dre Studio's, but great overall value.",446
3166,"I use them on my bike trainer so I can watch TV without having to turn the volume up to 100, and I don't have to adjust them every 5 seconds.",446
3167,"So I can hear cars coming, but it doesn't interfere with my music.",446
3168,"They are a little bigger, but they fold up more easily and can be wound up and tossed in a bag.",446
3169,"They're also lightly made, so I won't be surprised if the padding wears out or something snaps, but for this price they're easily replaced.",446
3170,"Generally, hardware with SONY written on the side of it performs well.",446
3171,They are great.,446
3172,Oh mey gerd...I ordered a pair of headphones and guess what I got?!,446
3173,Bought these because a lot of people were giving them crazy good reviews saying they were amazing for the money.,446
3174,I can now use my phone charger instead of having to locate my old phone charger and have two chargers.,446
3175,Bought this for my daughter to use on her tablet and in school.,447
3176,Disclosure: Kinivo provided me the Kinivo BTH240.,447
3177,"they are light weight and confortable, but i wish the cord was a little more longer since i use them in the computer at work and is kinda hard to move around with shoert cord...",447
3178,"As far as the Kinivo BTH240s, I read the reviews and the 'tweaks' that were made to improve it made it seem like the perfect match for what I was looking for.",447
3179,I've had a pair of these (white) for three years and they are still going strong.,447
3180,"They are very easy to use, and very easy to pair with devices.",447
3181,still working a month later anyway.,447
3182,"So as long as you are not not using them in that situation, they work great and they are comfortable.",447
3183,"after 1 hour of this thing, my head starts hurting cause the headband on top is made of hard plastic.",447
3184,I can barely feel that they are even on my head.,447
3185,I love being able to watch movies or tv shows without bothering my wife or other people.,447
3186,"I've had these headphones for about three months of heavy use and wear, and they work great.",447
3187,Controls are simple to operate.,447
3188,They fit so comfortably and nicely!,447
3189,Pleased with the durability and reasonable price.,447
3190,Only dislike is the way they hang on my ears and compete with my glasses.,447
3191,But I'll need to take anger management classes if I keep them myself.,447
3192,"I don't know if something in the vicinity interferes with the connection or what, but I think the convenience of having a bluetooth headset outweighs the few hickups every now and then.",447
3193,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,447
3194,The cable is a quite a bit shorter than the 7506s.,447
3195,"I have been looking everywhere for the right pair of workout headphones, and these are it!",447
3196,Even Sony considers the mdr v150's to be in the caliber of their professional studio headphones.,447
3197,"Even with these nitpicks, I still give these 5/5 stars.",447
3198,"I had purchased a much more expensive, brand name set and found they hurt my ears.",447
3199,The cord is very thick and can take a decent amount of stress so the wires are undamaged.,447
3200,10 year old used them on a long car ride.,448
3201,I would definitely recommend these to those who don't want to spend too much but still get good sound in return.,448
3202,Looks like a very expensive pair of headphones and has good sound.,448
3203,These are great.,448
3204,Great for the price.,448
3205,"They also cancel other sound remarkable well, almost dangerously so if they were worn outside running!",448
3206,We've owned three pairs of these headphones.,448
3207,"The sound quality is great, and they do block outside noise pretty well (not noise cancelling like my others, but decent for most uses.)",448
3208,$15 for over the ear headphones is a good price.,448
3209,Sony headphones are pretty good with great sound and fix very well on my head and ears.,448
3210,I have been very happy up until now.,448
3211,Great price for a pretty ok sound.,448
3212,I will continue to purchase these headphones whenever they wear out!,448
3213,The only negative is the material around the headphones has started to peel off.,448
3214,Even Sony considers the mdr v150's to be in the caliber of their professional studio headphones.,448
3215,I used these for about a month until the battery died.,448
3216,I use my phone for listening to music or audiobooks while driving and watching movies or my droidtv when I'm not.,448
3217,"Anyway, these work really well and seem like they would last a long time--if you keep them out of your mouth.",448
3218,The head phones worked great for 5 months and then one side of the headphone s broke and you can't hear anything on the left side but other than that they are pretty good,448
3219,"My main issue is that they keep cutting out, like multiple times in the length of a single song.",448
3220,"Since these cover the ear, I figured I'd give them a shot.",448
3221,It isn't that bad unless you want the music blasting your ears off in which these won't do.,448
3222,They only broke when I accidentialy had them in my pocket while kayaking.,448
3223,These are just the ticket.,448
3224,The only issue I have ever had is after 5 years of continuous use and abuse the headband has become loose (grip wise) so when I bend down they have a tendency to start slipping off.,448
3225,I bought them to use at my desk at work and they are good for that.,449
3226,"(walls being in the way seem to be the biggest issue...)

overall, i'd recommend these to anyone looking for a round-the-back style bluetooth headset.",449
3227,"Not too bad for $15-20 and of course not $200 Beats or Bose sounding, but At $20 I also have a pair of Sennheiser HD202s that blow these Sonys out of the water.",449
3228,When i would out on my Treadclimber the sound is great and really gets me going.,449
3229,I bought these because I'm a hooper and I like to practice in the wee hours when everyone else is asleep.,449
3230,"After initially pairing to your computer, all you have to do is turn the device on and it will connect automatically.",449
3231,I decided to buy a pair of over the ear headphones and saw these at a reasonable price.,449
3232,These sound great!,449
3233,I can't believe how small this headset really is.,449
3234,"We have been very pleased with the quality of these, especially for the money.",449
3235,Very good volume.,449
3236,I have been using these headphones for months and they are still in good working order.,449
3237,"One problem is they are a little small, and hurt your ears after a while.",449
3238,I use them at work and it's a great signal to others that I literally cannot hear them talking behind me since the headphones can be seen.,449
3239,I was worried that the area where the ears would rest would be stiff and not be very comfortable against my ears.,449
3240,"Smooth deep sounding bass, clear, crisp treble, almost no distortion at very high levels (not recommended).",449
3241,The cord length is good.,449
3242,I didn't expect that it will come earlier than I expected.,449
3243,"The first few weeks, after about 45 minutes, I felt some mild ear soreness.",449
3244,They're the best ones I've ever owned.,449
3245,"This set can be stored away flattened, you simply turn the phones in sideways.",449
3246,The only reason I bought these headphones was because I'm a broke college student who couldn't stand the soupcan sound of the iPhone earbuds anymore.,449
3247,"-Good sound, with good bass.",449
3248,I am a transcriptionist and work 10 hours a day.,449
3249,and I had it for a year now its been up with my nieces pulling and them sitting on top of them and I will say its put up with all that abuse lol.,449
3250,They sound great and I love the phone feature.,450
3251,This is my second Kinivo and I absolutely enjoy it.,450
3252,"Build quality is great cord length is actually perfect comfort is excellent, but the sound quality is most important.",450
3253,Loud enough to hear over the mower and long enough to last a work day.,450
3254,I use them at work and it's a great signal to others that I literally cannot hear them talking behind me since the headphones can be seen.,450
3255,"I didn't want to support the hyped up Beats, since they're very low quality and very overpriced, but I wanted something that would sound great and look sharp.",450
3256,They aren't amazing by any means and at times seems a little fuzzy.,450
3257,They have a soft rubber cover over where the wire meets the male connector (i.e.,450

3264,I really like it for listening functions.,450
3265,You'll get distortion at about 80% on your iDevice.,450
3266,"After I bought these, I noticed that a lot of people have them which is not surprising.",450
3267,Maybe it's because I have a big head.,450
3268,*Update* I had to buy a new one at three and half years but I bought the same ones again because they pair so well and I had no issues with them.,450
3269,Would buy another pair if I needed one.,450
3270,I got a pair of Sony headphones about 10 years ago that are a lot better than these and only cost me $7.99.,450
3271,You simply can't go wrong with a Sony product.,450
3272,"It seems like they have definitely worked the bugs out of these, at least for my use.",450
3273,I went straight the amazon webpage and found that the Kinivo BTH240 would be a good fit for him.,450
3274,"I used to use cheap wired headphones to listen to my podcasts, I would go through a pair a month, these have lasted me 8 months so it's a great value.",450
3275,The collapsible headphones make for easy storage but because of this the headphones are small on the head.,451
3276,The other person could not hear me.,451
3277,"Where the Sony's fit the average human head perfectly and securely, the Kinivo's dig into your skull and start hurting after wearing them any longer than a few minutes.",451
3278,"In conclusion, a great deal (in my opinion), with some nice touches.",451
3279,I had those same ones in white and they lasted 3 years of very heavy child use.,451
3280,This pair must have a short it never stays connected it beeps all day long going in and out.,451
3281,"Cons
- Slight rattle - I own a couple of pairs of these headphones.",451
3282,I work in a lab and have to move around a lot while working so getting rid of cables was my highest priority followed closely by battery life.,451
3283,"Maybe these aren't perfectly audiophile but it would be hard to touch this quality without spending a whole, whole lot more.",451
3284,Very comfortable to wear even with long hear flowing over.,451
3285,I started my music player on my phone and the sound was great.,451
3286,Great deal for headphones.,451
3287,I've used these headphones off and on for a couple of years now with various devices (both phones and tablets) and haven't experienced any trouble.,451
3288,For the money you can't go wrong.,451
3289,I told everyone I know about this product.,451
3290,They don't hug my head too tightly (where I might get a headache).,451
3291,"Contrary to other reviewers, I did not find them to be so comfortable for long periods.",451
3292,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,451
3293,one word amazing!!,451
3294,I should of bought this headphones a long time ago .,451
3295,These head phones have worked like charm.,451
3296,"After I bought these, I noticed that a lot of people have them which is not surprising.",451
3297,Definitely recommend!,451
3298,"The only real downside is the cord length is short, which I knew about in advance - not an issue for me because I keep my pc on the desk where it should be.",451
3299,"I actually bought a pair of these a year ago and have gotten a lot of use out of them-- I bring them to work in my bag and wear them on walks, to cut down on background noise, and for motivation boosts.",451

3310,Love these and would purchase again.,452
3311,"It's pretty interesting, I am a Sony guy, TV's, Playstations, Phones for years.",452
3312,"I'm about to get another pair.....the other two grew legs

Very rugged (they last a long time), no shedding (some earphones do), and I really like the weight and size",452
3313,"This headphones are very comfortable for extended periods of use, I use them watching movies and they stay in place well with no discomfort to your ears.",452
3314,One charge lasts basically all day.,452
3315,For a low end headphone the plastic is very sturdy and solid.,452
3316,"I had purchased a much more expensive, brand name set and found they hurt my ears.",452
3317,Because the top part of the ear is in between the ear piece and the part that goes behind the head.,452
3318,"everything is perfect except for the soft fabric inside, on top of the speakers.",452
3319,my 5th generation apple headphones actually sound better then these!,452
3320,Easy to set up and control.,452
3321,"I tried other brands and they were okay, but ultimately proved to either be a bit uncomfortable (too rigid) or the speakers would get damaged with the least amount of moisture (sweat).",452
3322,The flat sound and bulky earpieces ruin the headphone experience.,452
3323,My teenage son uses them constantly and hasn't had any problems.,452
3324,I was really surprised at the sound quality and also how comfortable this headphone is.,452
3325,They are light and pretty comfortable (very comfortable compared to ear-buds).,453
3326,They got me on my feet when i first started recording music,453
3327,"I have, some years ago, bought these headphones and they have held up well, I will probably buy them again one day.",453
3328,I also like how the ear piece swivels to make a much more comfortable fit.,453
3329,"The only downside is the lack of microphone, and fact that they don't fold up as nicely as other pairs.",453
3330,I let people listen and now 3 other people have bought them.,453
3331,Also better construction than I dreamed for the price.,453

3333,Not recommend this to anyone!,453
3334,They pair nicely and hold a connection with no problem.,453
3335,"The Good:
Well built.",453
3336,"My light never dims, and the power never comes on when I unplug and hit the power on button.",453
3337,I was still using my sony earbuds when I ordered these and I am definitely sticking to the brand now.,453
3338,They work excellent!,453
3339,The biggest gripe I have with them is just how NOT loud they are.,453
3340,"I've used the headsets for two straight business days running for 10 hrs straight on both days before I had to recharge the headset, that is excellent.",453
3341,Highly recommended for anyone who wants something good that will last.,453
3342,I haven't tried it in a noise area for phone conversations.,453
3343,"Turn on the head set, it connects up via the adapter, and switches my audio out to the headset.",453
3344,"Comfortable, and sound quality is decent enough you don't hate life.",453
3345,"I own a Kinivo Bluetooth adapter to use these headphones with my Windows PC, when using Skype and when my smartphone is connected to the PC.",453
3346,As a telephone - sound quality when receiving and sending - I was not as impressed.,453
3347,I have to physically move the sound system's volume meter to be able to reach.,453
3348,"Because of this, this is something that's a must and these are not very loud.",453
3349,"They are very comfortable and also look nice in the white, I use these more than my iPhone 5 earbuds now.",453
3350,"It's got a very powerful transceiver, and will gladly keep you connected across the room from your source.",454
3351,"Used them on my droid but can play them very lound for some reason, i believe it is my phone though.",454
3352,Either girls or guys can wear them and they look really good on-- definitely look MUCH more expensive than they are.,454
3353,"Occasionally there is an odd distortion when connected to my computer, but a quick disconnect and reconnect fixes it.",454
3354,"The ear padding is very soft, and the headphones stay secure to your head without pressing in on your ears (which I find uncomfortable over long periods).",454
3355,I'll update my review once I sweat in these for a month or so during workouts.,454
3356,"Disappointed, but somewhat satisfied.",454
3357,"Despite their compact on-ear size, these are very big head friendly.",454
3358,"And finally, a curious statement printed on the back of the package: ""If you use the headphones with WALKMAN that has a noise canceling function, the noise canceling function will not work.""",454
3359,I did a lot of research before finally purchasing these and I am happy with my decision.,454
3360,"I bought them for my 13 year old son, so his stupid games on his stupid tablet don't annoy me (smiley face).",454
3361,The sound quality feedback for talking is very poor.,454
3362,The collapsible headphones make for easy storage but because of this the headphones are small on the head.,454
3363,I would not recommend traveling with these.,454
3364,"Cheap feeling, stiff, and basically NO bass whatsoever.",454
3365,I would definitely buy them again!,454
3366,"My husband ordered them for me, and I won't wear them.",454
3367,"However, it would be even better of they had the option to connect to devices that do not carry the blue tooth feature.",454
3368,They don't really stay in place for me when I am working out and they do cause some slight discomfort behind the ears for me.,454
3369,"I believe I got a knock off, it does not look like sony quality.",454
3370,I had to purchase a second one because of that.,454
3371,"Also for my MP3 player, like I said they do drain the batteries kinda fast.",454
3372,I can hear if my phone rings :),454
3373,"The padding for the ears is way too small, and this would seem comfortable to a small child.",454
3374,Gone are the days you can buy a well made pair of headphones or ear-buds for a decent price that will last.,454
3375,Something I cannot do with a couple of other headphones I own that have oval shaped cushions (i.e.,455
3376,"For headphones that cost $14, Sony's WDRZX100 Outdoor Headphones are solid.",455
3377,They are great for running or other exercise.,455
3378,The flap is useless and always sticking out making the BTH240 unappealing.,455
3379,"Still these are ten bucks, no way these can compete with more expensive headphones.",455
3380,Unfortunately they will stop holding a charge after a month or so of everyday use.,455
3381,I've had mine for two years and it's still going strong!,455
3382,A great headset at an affordable price.,455
3383,The sound quality is very good for the price.,455
3384,But there are other affordable options out there that perform a little better.,455
3385,"Before I even downloaded all my songs to the new MP3 I purchased from Amazon at the same time as these groovy headphones, one of the earpieces fell into a vodker and soda...soaked to schmitt.",455
3386,I am not happy with them.,455
3387,I was using wired headphones that didn't have a mic so I feel safer being out in the pre-dawn knowing I can call out at the press of a button on my headset.,455
3388,I think these were aimed at teens and tweens with smaller heads.,455
3389,This is actually the second pair of these that I've purchased.,455
3390,I bought these headphones in hopes that they would look good.,455
3391,"So if you have physically sensitive outer ears, you might want to look at a different style.",455
3392,Efficiency: This just means how loud they go.,455
3393,These headphones are great.,455
3394,"i been through some good times with these headphones, Thank God for putting these headphones in my life.",455
3395,Don't get me wrong I love this product and I went safe and purchased the product from amazon not a seller.,455
3396,I road my bike around the neighborhood with them on and they shifted alot and I just couldn't get them to sit comfortably on my BIG head,455
3397,I am overall very impressed with this company.,455
3398,"SO because of that, I am reordering another of the same pair now in April 2016.",455
3399,The only thing I didn't like was that after a bit the top of my head where the band goes across gets warm ... but that also happens if I so much as wear a hat.,455
3400,I suspect that my product was just an outlier but beware of the possibility.,456
3401,"Also, the volume is great for me and it works well with my hearing aid.",456
3402,I bought 2 pairs of head phone for a long trip to Asia.,456
3403,I've bought three generations of these headphones.,456
3404,Turn it up and jam!!!,456
3405,i put these headphones through a lot of crap.,456
3406,My last pair were with me for daily use for almost 4 years and only had to be replaced when my cat helpfully chewed through the cord.,456
3407,"As for quality of material and comfort, I would like to give these headphones a 4 out of 5 on quality of material.",456
3408,"The unit connects well to my Samsung phone, good sound, etc.",456
3409,"For its price, this delivers very good sound.",456
3410,Do yourselves a favor and a little extra money on better headphones!,456
3411,All the buttons were unresponsive and the headset wouldn't shut off.,456
3412,They feel cheap but you what you pay for.,456
3413,"I told him i had got these Sony headphones your tablet, when plugged the headphones into his tablet  only 1 speaker would sound  (the left side only).",456
3414,"I bought this and the bth220 headphones and they have great sound quality and the first charge they lasted at least 16 hours, so with wear and tear over time I'm sure the 8 hour rating they give them will more than hold true.",456
3415,"If you're like me and listen to music or movies occasionally, these are perfect.",456
3416,"I was going to send them back, but my husband (who does not have any type of TMJ or jaw ache issues) decided to keep them as jogging headphones.",456
3417,I've been using this to listen to movies I watch on Netflix on my nook.,456
3418,I am a bit of an audiophile and purchased MDRZX100/White for a non-music related work.,456
3419,I don't take these outside and I barely use it indoors.,456
3420,Save your money and get a different product.,456
3421,They stay put without issue.,456
3422,Its more about the comfort while using it,456
3423,And plenty of reviewers here swear by their comfort and ability to stay on while exercising.,456
3424,"Though I am sure over time I may find complications and if I do I will update this; regardless I will still update this in 3 months, 6 months and a year.",456
3425,You have to add this to your collection.,457
3426,My only complaint is that I wish it didn't have a split cable.,457
3427,"Good soun quality for simple video, music and talk hands free.",457
3428,"I keep them in the outside pocket of my gym bag and they have not broken, I am a little careful with them because they are slight, but that is better than some bulky heavy monster headphones.",457
3429,"Plug doesn't fit my macbook pro; too loose, keeps falling out.",457
3430,They have a soft rubber cover over where the wire meets the male connector (i.e.,457
3431,I was nervous about the volume being too low since everyone was talking about noise cancelation type stuff but I use them and can't hear a thing besides my music and that's all I could ask for!!,457
3432,The headset works as advertised.,457
3433,"If you plan on wearing these for extended periods of time, you'll have to take a break every once and a while with them off, the pressure on your head can be too much.",457
3434,Normally cheap headphones are tinny and junky sounding but these really sound good.,457
3435,"Bottom line, music playback is excellent.",457
3436,"2) They are uncomfortable to wear
3) They look funny when you wear them in public.",457
3437,I am so happy with these and I sleep quite well.,457
3438,The headphone are not the best in the world or even top of the line.,457
3439,Sound not too bad though but won't recommend for training.,457
3440,"However, the Kinivo BTH240 pair up every time, no matter what device I am connecting them to...and for a $30 device, this is impressive.",457
3441,10 year old used them on a long car ride.,457
3442,The sound - is decent.,457
3443,This set delivers in all aspects and lets me listen to my music without the whole house having to listen to it as well.,457
3444,They work perfect and we have no problem.,457
3445,They are easy to set up.,457
3446,If you just want to enjoy your music and want headphones that are durable get these instead.,457
3447,The battery life is out of this world.,457
3448,Not really worth it.,457
3449,Comfortable on my head.,457
3450,"Sound quality is the same which is good, but they do not quite fit my large head and are not quite as comfortable.",458
3451,Read one review that made me think twice about this product where a customer said not for people with large head size however I am not the smallest guy and these phones fit me just fine.,458
3452,"Even though they wrap around the back of the head, they still stay on through my routine.",458
3453,All the buttons were unresponsive and the headset wouldn't shut off.,458
3454,I had an employee there offer to actually let me try out a couple different pairs in the store before I purchased them.,458
3455,It cancels surrounding noise very well.,458
3456,"I like the easy connectivity, but what they are lacking is different audio settings.",458
3457,"I didn't want to support the hyped up Beats, since they're very low quality and very overpriced, but I wanted something that would sound great and look sharp.",458
3458,We've gone through a couple of pair but that's due more to misuse on her part.,458
3459,Will not be purchasing this model again.,458
3460,"Other than that they have great natural thumpin bass tones (frequencies) (not muddy or over exaggerated), the mids are there the highs are there.",458
3461,I have these in white and they are very good for what I need them.,458
3462,I've never really counted how long the duration of a single charge is but I'd like to say around 8 hours!,458
3463,"However, for the price and what they are used for...perfection!",458
3464,"I am wearing these headphones right now writing this review, and I am not even listening to music!",458

3470,"The sound is clear and of great quality, especially for the price!",458
3471,"For around $20, the sound quality is excellent, and would certainly recommend these to anyone looking for a VERY GOOD set of headphones, that just happen to be inexpensive.",458
3472,"Over a year and still work, purchased Dec 2015 and still sound great.",458
3473,In fact just yesterday was the first time that it didn't but that was related to the adapter not the headphone.,458
3474,For $12 they are about all one could expect.,458
3475,Pretty good for the price - just interface quirks.,459
3476,i have seen the same review given by other people and it seems that they make this headphones just to rob money from people.,459
3477,She says they work great and she loves the quality of the sound.,459
3478,"Because of this, this is something that's a must and these are not very loud.",459
3479,I bought a black pair to go along with the black stage dress protocol.,459
3480,They work great for the children in eliminating background noises & listening to their teachers.,459
3481,The box of the earphone was opened a bit but they did mention that may happen but they arrived safe and sound.,459
3482,They produce crisp high's and nice bass with balanced midrange.,459
3483,"These were very good headphones for a while, but after only 6 months, the sound on one side went out completely.",459
3484,"Basically, I take VOIP calls/meetings now and I don't have to use my desk phone/home phone / cell phone.",459
3485,"I've purchased some other headphones in this price range that have served me well, but I don't think these would make it a week.",459
3486,The biggest gripe I have with them is just how NOT loud they are.,459
3487,"The only thing i didn't like , is how it was packaged.",459
3488,They bounce just slightly when on a run but will not fall off.,459
3489,Gave them to my husband hoping his larger head will stretch them out for me :),459
3490,I really like these.,459
3491,"Honestly, spend a little more money and get a nicer pair of headphones.",459
3492,"The speaker began to crackle in my left ear (it sounded as if it was max volume out of that ear, while the right ear was working normally at the set volume).",459
3493,Only draw back is when they're on people can hear the music you're playing and I was looking for a pair of headphones that I can use while my son is napping or in the bed while I'm working during the wee hours.,459
3494,The pair they replaced lasted TWO YEARS until they fell into a hot tub.,459
3495,I use these daily and love them!,459
3496,Bought for myself.,459
3497,"The sound is quite good even on a crowded airplane; the padding around the ears is very comfortable, but also hasn't peeled or frayed.",459
3498,I ended up donating them to our local thrift store after one use.,459
3499,Surprise--there are differences.,459
3500,"Up until last night, I was really kind of bragging about how great the second set had been.",460
3501,"Works fine, but not satisfied with quality.",460
3502,"For the price, you can't go wrong really.",460
3503,"The only issue I've encountered is that I like to use this pair with multiple devices (phone/tablet/computer), and on occasion I have to repair.",460
3504,"The comfort level was among the best I have experienced for this kind of headset, as long as I'm not leaning/laying my head against anything.",460
3505,I'm sure this plastic would snap if you twisted these too firmly or stepped on them too hard.,460
3506,Got these for my son for school and they work great.,460
3507,I though it was kool that i was jamming out to Iheart radio at the gym the other day and my song pauses and i hear thing ringing and push the ear piece answer button on the side of the head phones and a super clear hands free phone call.,460
3508,The Sony head phones are amazing.,460
3509,They feel cheap but don't look it so I guess that is okay.,460
3510,"After all they've been through, they are still working in perfect condition.",460
3511,"These sound very good, not awesome.",460
3512,I use these with my iPhone.,460
3513,"Within 5 seconds use could see there is a very noticeable lag in audio and what the video is doing, a second or two delay.",460
3514,I find the little red indicator that tells which side is the right side very handy and thoughtful too.,460
3515,"They don't have intense bass but I don't really go for that anyway, If you're looking for bass I've seen good reviews for the bass on the Sony MDRZX300.",460
3516,"I can hear everyone very clearly on my Samsung S5, and they can hear me.",460
3517,They are also great for air travel.,460
3518,"You can even hear some decent bass at a moderate volume, but keep in mind these are small, cheap headphones, not a subwoofer.",460
3519,"You can't use them in loud spaces, on motorized vehicles, God help you if you try to listen to them on the plane.",460
3520,"""They work"" is about all I can say about these headphones.",460
3521,"Overall, I'm a happy customer.",460
3522,Easy to pair with devices also.,460
3523,I would recommend these to anyone looking for bluetooth headphones at a decent price.,460
3524,"I thought these were going to be good quality sound, but their worst then walmart $5 headphones.",460
3525,"The cords are thicker than my old headphones, but other than that, i love it!",461
3526,These work excellent in an office work environment or at home.,461
3527,"They don't have intense bass but I don't really go for that anyway, If you're looking for bass I've seen good reviews for the bass on the Sony MDRZX300.",461
3528,"The only real downside is the cord length is short, which I knew about in advance - not an issue for me because I keep my pc on the desk where it should be.",461
3529,They are not the best head phones in the world but the fact that they are Sony and cost an affordable price makes them great to use.,461
3530,At first was comfortable and snug on my head.,461
3531,"Overall, they are well worth the money.",461
3532,I thought I missed charging this completely.,461
3533,The headband is way too rigid and totally uncomfortable.,461
3534,"The ear piece is a bit big, but you get an amazing sound from them almost like stereo head srt.",461
3535,Bluetooth range not great but not a detractor.,461
3536,They also stay put.,461
3537,"Bought this to replace an older model BTH240 (which was great), but this one is slow to connect, frequently drops out or outright disconnects.",461
3538,Pros - They are made for traveling.,461
3539,Both product's signal range and charge times are similar.,461
3540,"They are cheap and produce good, clear sound into your ears.",461
3541,Now I am stuck with some useless headphones.,461
3542,"I just needed an affordable headphone for listening on mi IPhone and iPad,this works and was cheaper then stores near me.",461
3543,They get fairly loud and Don't distort at high volume.,461
3544,Perhaps someone reading this review will have an idea.,461
3545,"So, I don't know how these hold up to active uses.",461
3546,You won't be disappointed.,461
3547,"The white is nice and the red is a cute touch, I get a lot of compliments on these.",461
3548,"Being a rather critical music listener I bought five different sets of on-ear type headphones to choose among, comparing all of them with the equalizer set to flat across.",461
3549,"My wife can wear them so we kept them, but they need a redesign to be adjustable.",461
3550,"I used them for several hours every day, and only charge them up once a week.",462
3551,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,462
3552,They work quite well with a Nook HD+ and allow me to move without being entangled in wires when I put the Nook down to do something else.,462
3553,I've been through a few head phones so I was something of a skeptic.,462
3554,"I say, if you want brand A quality then buy brand A.",462
3555,All three are in great working condition and my kids do a good job of working them.,462
3556,I bought these for use on an airplane to shut out external sounds a bit.,462
3557,the next time you go shopping.,462
3558,Blocks some subway noice but i can still hesr the train.,462
3559,Best blutooth headphones I've purchased.,462
3560,"If you're like me and listen to music or movies occasionally, these are perfect.",462
3561,I do occasionally get static when I'm downtown as if a stronger signal just temporarily overwhelmed my bluetooth connection and I have to back up 30 seconds on my audiobook to hear what I missed.,462
3562,These headphones are extremely uncomfortable to use for more than a few minutes at a time.,462
3563,These are still working for me.,462
3564,They are one ear so noise is not shut out completely.,462
3565,The pause works great.,462
3566,Thought about trying others just to compare but had to stick with this great product at a great price.,462
3567,the next time you go shopping.,462
3568,I was so excited to try these out considering all the positive reviews.,462
3569,Incoming phone call?,462
3570,"The MDR-V300s also have 30mm drivers, but they have a better magnet, which I assume makes a big difference.",462
3571,"It's got a very powerful transceiver, and will gladly keep you connected across the room from your source.",462
3572,i was considering for weeks getting some dre beats headphones for my workouts but for 200 dollars they better come with a mobile personal DJ.. gave these a try and am very happy with the sound and comfort and saving $175 for the holidays,462
3573,"Overall if you're on a budget and can't really spend more than 20 bucks on headphones go with these, you won't be disappointed.",462
3574,My sone broke his and we purchased another about a year ago.,462
3575,These are a great fit for my small head.,463
3576,I will just say you should probably get lil more expensive headphones,463
3577,"Call quality is even exceptional, though I try not to use them for that purpose, as I tend to talk a magnitude or two louder when I use them.",463
3578,I have always felt like they made a good product for value headphones.,463
3579,"Also keep in mind, because these are behind the ear headphones, if you are leaning back against something, like sitting up in bed or laying down on a pillow, this kind of pushes them forward.",463
3580,"Most have written long reviews about Sonys cheap alternative, I am going to keep it short.",463
3581,I love sony headphones I have the white pair and I have the black pair now.,463
3582,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,463
3583,The only thing I miss in these headphones is padding on top.,463
3584,I should have bought two of these.,463
3585,These work excellent in an office work environment or at home.,463
3586,I darn near consider em a wannabe beats headset.,463
3587,Very impressed with how long they can go without a charge.,463
3588,"Overall, great product and worth the cost!",463
3589,I bought these headphones due to a review by the wirecutter and I can say that it lived up to their praise.,463
3590,Might give this to my more petite wife and find something else!,463
3591,We could go through about 8 of these in a year and still not hit the prices of one pair of Beats!,463
3592,The bass is weak and oppressed.,463
3593,"I get a crazy long range, maybe about 100-150 feet from one end of the plant to the trailer bay.",463
3594,Good quality sound for a half-decent price.,463
3595,Used them for my workouts until one day (after a owning them only a month) they stopped holding a charge.,463
3596,MUSIC / CALL AUDIO QUALITY : The sound quality is very much acceptable considering the price you pay for this.,463
3597,"PROS: Perfect for any mp3 player, tablet, audio device, and computer using a 3.5mm audio jack (virtually all mainstream devices do).",463
3598,It's not a big difference -- it took several back-and-forths to pin it down --  but it is noticeable.,463
3599,However if u want to go jogging or bike riding then u may have some connections issues and that is the case for most if not all bluetooth wireless headsets.,463
3600,"It's OK if you are listening to loud music, but for softer stuff not so much.",464
3601,"No, I don't have a huge head.",464
3602,I bought my first pair of these in 2013.,464
3603,"We are very actively involved with exercising at the y every day and
use these wireless to listen to music as we exercise.",464
3604,I wouldn't recommend these.,464
3605,"As for ambient sounds, when you are wearing them, they are a bit muffled, but not blocked.",464
3606,"Sound is pretty good, but do not buy if you intend to use for workouts.",464
3607,I cannot believe that headphones that are 11$ could be this good.,464
3608,These headphones are definitely better than some but they aren't anything to write home about.,464
3609,"-Good sound, with good bass.",464
3610,These headphones are the perfect mixture of BOTH.,464
3611,I bought this for my 14-year-old.,464
3612,Just got back from a 2100 mile road trip and these held up to abuses of 3 young boys tossing them around the car for 2 weeks!,464
3613,"However, the time has come to replace them.",464
3614,Nice little headphones.,464
3615,"are very comfortable, I like the color green, but on the picture they see green with white, and when they arrived they were green with beige, but equally the use that is given is good, we like a good buy",464
3616,"You can fold the ears of the headphones, too.",464
3617,Poor quality manufacturing all around.,464
3618,"Every time I turned on these headphones, it typically would take a couple seconds longer to sync up with my phone than other Bluetooth headphones I've used in the past.",464
3619,"Maybe I got a defective product or something, but the volume that I hear things on this headphone is just way too low and because of that it makes it seem like I am listening to everything through muddy water.",464
3620,Great sound quality.,464
3621,They are comfortable and well worth the price.,464
3622,"If you have prominent ridges on your ears and normal head phones bother you, don't buy these because it will be just as bad if not worse.",464
3623,contacted kinivo's customer service and the rep emailed me a return label.,464
3624,"If you're looking for a affordable and good quality headphone, I will recommend these headphones.",464
3625,"Now, I figured since it was suck a bargain there would be a catch, and of course there was.",465
3626,"Sound in both ears is clear, they're comfortable for long periods of time, i've dropped them on numerous occasions and the plastic hasn't cracked or really scuffed at all.",465
3627,Do not make the same mistake .,465
3628,"These are good, inexpensive general purpose headphones.",465
3629,you get what you pay for...,465
3630,I go through headphones very quickly (three or four pairs in the last year).,465
3631,Luckily the main box was fine and nothing was broken.,465
3632,It's easy to switch to accept or make a phone call.,465
3633,I looked at several different makes and models and decided to try these.,465
3634,One of the speaker has stopped working and I can't use it any longer.,465
3635,"Dont know why, but the microphone didn't work...",465
3636,My co-worker noticed the improvements that another reviewer has already went into good detail about.,465
3637,I am so pleased with this product and have already recommended it to several people!!!,465
3638,After this experience I decided to purchase another pair of 220's which I also enjoyed very much before my original pair failed.,465
3639,"The over the ear design works better than ear buds, which tend to fall out of their little ears.",465
3640,Also whenever there is high bass the left side begins to rattle badly which disrupts my music.,465
3641,"Not a big deal tough...

Worth the price, if you are looking for a cheap Bluetooth Headphone, this one is probably will fit your necessities.",465
3642,Bought these for my son.,465
3643,Owned for over 6 months and still very happy.,465
3644,My only complaint is that I wish it didn't have a split cable.,465
3645,Wondering how long before it breaks but I'm guessing it will really last...hahaha.,465
3646,I am also very happy with Kinivo's customer service.,465
3647,I charge them about once a week if not less.,465
3648,(The working part of the aids are outside the ear.),465
3649,"back on they go...she is disabled so i,m glad to have  something of good quality that she gets so much joy from,  and at a reasonable price,  thanks again.",465
3650,"Lightweight, feels comfortable around ears, and provides above-average sound for the price.",466
3651,"This is an Awsome wireless BlueTooth headset, especially for the bargain price.",466
3652,The cord is also nice and thick not thin and cheesy.,466
3653,10 year old used them on a long car ride.,466
3654,"There was always something missing: Bad fit, poor sound quality, lack of comfort, etc.",466
3655,"The range is good, the price was great, and they sound quality is nice.",466
3656,Range on the bluetooth is pretty generous before the audio drops.,466
3657,"For the asking price, these are excellent quality and a fantastic value.",466
3658,After the first time I charged up the headset the rubber flap that covers the USB port won't seal closed and flops open a bit.,466
3659,I've been through many bluetooth headphones and these are at the top of the list.,466
3660,"Also, they didn't share room well with my glasses.",466
3661,Bottom line: The sound is very clear and they are easy to use.,466
3662,It cancels surrounding noise very well.,466
3663,These sound horrible and Sony should make the design engineer wear ribbons of shame.,466
3664,Battery life is good.,466
3665,"It keeps cutting out, or warbling distortedly.",466
3666,Color: Black I have purchased 3 of these and one has lasted for several years.,466
3667,These work excellent in an office work environment or at home.,466
3668,They don't move around when I run.,466
3669,"I bought two of them, one for each of my daughters.",466
3670,"The headphones work with the tablet these were purchased for, what else can you ask for.",466
3671,In my opinion these are so much better than the crap beats by dre.,466
3672,"Easy to set up with Android Bluetooth, long battery life, fits well.",466
3673,I am seriously amazed at how good these sound.,466
3674,These don't fit extremely well on my gigantic (7 7/8) head.,466
3675,"(4) The head phone boasts connectivity to multiple devices at once, but never worked for me, tried using two mobile phones.",467
3676,Sound is Muffled like it needs more power to drive it?,467
3677,Before buying them I was a little hesitant based on reviews from other users on amazon.,467
3678,This was my ideal situation!,467
3679,These headphones are the most uncomfortable I've ever owned.,467
3680,The only difference between these functions it how long the button is held or whether it is hit more than once.,467
3681,They sound great and I love the phone feature.,467
3682,"I have spent the past few months looking for a cheap bluetooth option because when the family is at home, and I'm on the treadmill watching whatever on the TV, I can listen to it without disturbing them.",467
3683,The Sony head phones are amazing.,467
3684,one word amazing!!,467
3685,There is a slight delay with the sound.,467
3686,"The sound is crisp and clear, and they are pretty loud.",467
3687,I have finally found a set of wireless headphones that stay on my ears without being too bulky.,467
3688,He is very picky about his electronics.,467
3689,I own a pair I bought two years ago in-store.,467
3690,I'm using it right now and have been the last 4 hours... still no feed me beep and I still haven't charged it....it's awesome.,467
3691,This Sony product is the best stereo headphone I have purchased to date and it exceeded my expectations.,467
3692,I've paired this with my Note2 and macbook air with no issues.,467
3693,They are perfect for my needs.,467
3694,I now feel like I have either an oversized head or ears.,467
3695,And sometimes they send used products.,467
3696,My daughter uses these with her studio equipment.,467
3697,"These wouldn't pair with my Girlfriend's iPhone or iPad, My iPhone or iPad.",467
3698,The Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone exceeded my expectations.,467
3699,I've had this for about 3 weeks now and I freaking love it!,467
3700,Not expensive but works great.,468
3701,"Plus, the cups themselves are not too big and bulky, so they're very easy to carry around and fit in your backpack.",468
3702,Apparently the honeymoon is over.,468
3703,These phones are used by a deaf friend of mine so he can listen to audio books.,468
3704,I'm by no means an audiophile.,468
3705,"UPDATE: After a couple years of being dropped, stepped on, and listened to, these still work.",468
3706,"But I highly suggest these headphones because for $11, you cant beat the price for the quality you get they are well worth it.",468
3707,Maybe it's supposed to do that for when you just want to let them hang around your neck but that certainly doesn't make them anymore comfortable.,468
3708,These head phones have worked like charm.,468
3709,Then I accidentally snapped them in half lol because I thought they were fold able ( completely my fault; just know that they aren't fold able).,468
3710,the sound is amazing quality is good and i loved the price you cant beat under 20 for sony headphones.,468
3711,They are one ear so noise is not shut out completely.,468
3712,sound quality is good and for the price you cant get any better.,468
3713,I will be echoing the sentiments of many.,468
3714,Can't wear for more than a few minutes unless I only keep it on one ear.,468
3715,Had to figure out best wearing configuration i.e.,468
3716,"I haven't tried thee with my iPod or any other devices, simply because I bought them for use with my Macbook .",468
3717,"Because of this, this is something that's a must and these are not very loud.",468
3718,"I read where it is hard to tell which side is L or R, I've found that the R has a small red band making it easy to define it as R.

I read where it needed a battery, there is no battery required.",468
3719,"Sony did a great job on these...would buy another pair,for the price...you can't go wrong...",468
3720,"They sent out a replacement BTH240 immediately, but I had the same problem with it.",468
3721,I use them on my daily walk.,468
3722,"back on they go...she is disabled so i,m glad to have  something of good quality that she gets so much joy from,  and at a reasonable price,  thanks again.",468
3723,"Looks great, sound quality is good, somewhat above average, but ear coverage is minimal, could easily (inexpensively) be and so should be larger, and I found the cord to be too short.",468
3724,Pretty decent sound quality.,468
3725,"So... my current earbuds NOW are a pair of Sharp earbuds, that came with an old cell phone, and are intended for phone use.",469
3726,I bought my daughter a pair for Christmas because I liked the color.,469
3727,I think I paid around $20 for these headphones and they are excellent!!,469
3728,I've been using them for more then a month and so far so good!,469
3729,Until one side of the headphones stopped working.,469
3730,Perfect for me at work.,469
3731,"The only reason I am giving one start less is, I want to know how much battery life is still remaining in the headset, which I can't see.",469
3732,These headphones are definitely better than some but they aren't anything to write home about.,469
3733,After receiving this product I discovered that it didn't live up to my expectations.,469
3734,They sound significantly worse than the $20 store-bought Sony headphones I'd been using.,469
3735,I would definitely buy them again!,469
3736,"Easy to use, light (in spite of their size), these headphones are really perfect.",469
3737,great for those days when the maintenance guys are using the leafblowers.,469
3738,"These are so comfortable that I can actually sleep in them all night if I want to, although they were not meant for that at all.",469
3739,I've never really counted how long the duration of a single charge is but I'd like to say around 8 hours!,469
3740,paired with my iphone5 - they aren't loud enough for my type of use ( mountain bike riding - working out- running) .,469
3741,"Also, these are not overly huge like other over ear headphones and since they cuff around your ears toward the back of your lower neck area, it doesn't get in the way of weight training.",469
3742,So with this order we have a set in the living room and now in the bedroom.,469
3743,"I tried them also, they sound ok for a budget price set.",469
3744,"The connection to my phone is great, so I can have it in my bag instead of a pocket like with a wired set.",469
3745,Headphones relatively comfortable.,469
3746,If you wear these headphones for to long they will make your ears red and sweaty plus really soar.,469
3747,Earpieces fold flat for stowing in a backpack.,469
3748,The base response is good.,469
3749,"The padding rests on your ear instead of around it like other, larger headphones.",469
3750,The only issue is when my husband lays down to do any workouts on the bench the back headphone bar pops up and makes the earpieces push up.,470
3751,"If you listen to music that isn't bass intensive or you don't really care about getting much bass, get these.",470
3752,sound quality is good and for the price you cant get any better.,470
3753,These headphones were recommended to me by a colleague.,470
3754,Phone calls can be a little on/off sometimes---callers can hear me perfectly fine but sometimes their phone calls get a little muffled.,470
3755,"Aside from that minor point, I am thoroughly delighted with my Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones.",470
3756,Got these for my son for school and they work great.,470
3757,I will not claim that these are the best headphones ever or underrated in any way because they don't have superb bass or tempo in comparison to the top brands of headphones.,470
3758,"There was always something missing: Bad fit, poor sound quality, lack of comfort, etc.",470
3759,"Also, it creaks and it doesn't feel like a quality craftsmanship.",470
3760,I recieved the headphones very quickly...,470
3761,"As you can gather from the title of this review, the product does not cancel noise.",470
3762,But its nice and durable.,470
3763,Wont be disappointed it gets the job done.,470
3764,I was skeptical getting these as I'm coming from having Rocket Fish bluetooth headphones.,470
3765,I'm really happy that I went with these headphones.,470
3766,I may need a little pocket charging unit on long outings.,470
3767,"they are simple yet elegent, they have a outstanding base, and are incredebly comfortable.",470
3768,"I just received these in the mail a couple of days ago so I can't write about how long they last or anything like that, but I can say that I absolutely love them especially for the price.",470
3769,Mid range and bass sound flabby and out of shape causing the highs to sound choppy.,470
3770,They work quite well with a Nook HD+ and allow me to move without being entangled in wires when I put the Nook down to do something else.,470
3771,Would definitely buy again.,470
3772,I tested these headphones on both my iPod touch and my PC and they both play beautifully but if you want it for use on your computer note that the cord is no more than two feet of extra cord.,470
3773,I was very surprised to experience the sound quality was just great.,470
3774,I tested these headphones on both my iPod touch and my PC and they both play beautifully but if you want it for use on your computer note that the cord is no more than two feet of extra cord.,470
3775,These are great head phones and don't cost a few hundred $$$..,471
3776,Calls are loud and clear and the microphone appears to be really good since everybody says they hear me clearly.,471
3777,I was nervous about the volume being too low since everyone was talking about noise cancelation type stuff but I use them and can't hear a thing besides my music and that's all I could ask for!!,471
3778,"Very clear sound, comfortable and light weight.",471
3779,I was also very surprised at how comfortable they are.,471
3780,It keeps my ears warms as a plus.,471
3781,"I didn't expect that much from them, but when my son (who is 8) started to rave about how awesome they are I had to try them out.",471
3782,I have been having multiple issues with the microphone input of the NEXUS 4 phone.,471
3783,"Unless they fix the firmware issues with these headphones, I would pass on these.",471
3784,"Don't expect what you might hear from 200-300 dollar headphones, but these are well worth the money!",471
3785,"The ends both turn flat, which is great for packing them in my bag with my books.",471
3786,It has a good level of keeping outside noises out but not to the extent where you can't hear anything.,471
3787,There's now a rubber cover on the micro USB jack; added protection from the elements and looks better.,471
3788,The cord is also nice and thick not thin and cheesy.,471
3789,These have good sound but are not what I would call fasntastic and they are also not noise canceling.,471
3790,"The Good:
Well built.",471
3791,I've tried turning them up as loud as I could with volume on my iPhone and on the headphones and they still aren't that loud.,471
3792,I need a ponytail in place to hold the headband up so that it doesn't drift down.,471
3793,"Amazing sound and good bass, but the headphones did not look good when you had them on.",471
3794,Guess I'll never know that though.,471
3795,I wear these at work.,471
3796,"If he wouldn't have kept them I would have given them a 2, but he thinks they're just fine and hasn't experienced any issues with them.",471
3797,Because the top part of the ear is in between the ear piece and the part that goes behind the head.,471
3798,Some customers had hard time to fit it.,471
3799,"These are simple, lightweight and sound good.",471
3800,This is more subtle.,472
3801,The only reason I did not give five stars - they are a little bulky (thick).,472
3802,After the first time I charged up the headset the rubber flap that covers the USB port won't seal closed and flops open a bit.,472
3803,I don't use them every day but I have had these for 2 years almost and they are going strong.,472
3804,Maybe wear them with a hat.,472
3805,"Deep, clear sound that you'd get from more expensive models.",472
3806,"For the price and style, you cannot go wrong in buying these headphones.",472
3807,For the money...they work well.,472
3808,"The more I try using other pairs of headphones or earbuds, the more I appreciate just how good these Sony headphones are.",472
3809,Perfect for every day use as well as recording.,472
3810,Low price available at Amazon.com only.,472
3811,This headphone isolates just enough sound for me to enjoy the music while letting some sound in which is essential for safety.,472
3812,They are exactly what I wanted I got them for my husband for Christmas and he loves he works in a factory with loud machines all around him and with these the noise is not a problem all He  could hear is  his music,472
3813,"Design features:

Size - I would call these a ""medium"" zize phone.",472
3814,If it manages to stay connected audio becomes laughably out of sync.,472
3815,"Just recently the plug does not stay in all the way in the headphone jack of either my iPad Mini, my Lenovo Tablet, or the TV.",472
3816,I should have known to go with Sony in the first place.,472
3817,I will not claim that these are the best headphones ever or underrated in any way because they don't have superb bass or tempo in comparison to the top brands of headphones.,472
3818,The bass is just awesome.,472
3819,I am happy the ear pieces turn for storage.,472
3820,The backbone of the headset rests behind your head on your neck.,472
3821,"The sound is crisp and clear, and they are pretty loud.",472
3822,I also use them to watch Netflix on my iPad and it paired easily with my iPad 4th generation.,472
3823,"After I head some fancy beats snap, I turned to these.",472
3824,Happy with the price point and glad I purchased them.,472
3825,"It's certainly adequate, but impossible to describe as loud.",473
3826,One charge lasts basically all day.,473
3827,I've also recommended them to several at the office for conference calls on the laptops.,473
3828,Not really worth it.,473
3829,"They're low priced, but get the job done.",473
3830,The shipping was fast and product as described.,473
3831,Batteries last ~12 hours of playback and as it turns out they work great for phone calls as well - bonus!,473
3832,But it's a good deal for what I'm using it for.,473
3833,"He loved the design and thought the sound was good, but this past week it stopped working.",473
3834,Replaced another pair which did not hold a charge for more than two hours.,473
3835,They fit comfortably and I use them at work in the office.,473
3836,"It's OK if you are listening to loud music, but for softer stuff not so much.",473
3837,She can wear them for hours while she studies without trouble.,473
3838,If not for the jack being as pictured I would have given this product 5 stars.,473
3839,Not clear if you can use a cigarette lighter USB charger in car or truck to supply charging power to the headphone when out and about.,473
3840,Hope this review isn't to confusing and if you have questions please ask!,473
3841,I purchased these based on the reviews but ended up very disappointed and returned them.,473
3842,Once again Sony has proven to provide a good quality product for a very reasonable price.,473
3843,I bought them because reviews on amazon said they were of the same quality of Beats by Dre.,473
3844,I'm not sure if its the brand or where I got it from but BUYER BEWARE!,473
3845,"If you need a pair for only 1 year, these are fine but don't expect to use them for 3 or more years, because they will disintegrate on your head",473
3846,"The earlier pairs I had were decent, they'd last about 6 months then just stop working.",473
3847,Pairing it to any bluetooth phone is easy.,473
3848,A design plus is the red band on the right side.,473
3849,"I like the slim form factor, and voice prompts mean I don't have to speak ""beep beep"" to understand what my headset is telling me.",473
3850,I have used these headphones on several runs and in the gym a few times now and I must say that I am quite impressed.,474
3851,"Alas, they did not.",474
3852,"I wish they were smaller, and I'd like a version that goes over the top of the head (instead of over the back).",474
3853,I use them at work all the time.,474
3854,This item was delivered promptly and as agreed on.,474
3855,These are fine.,474
3856,"Best for skinny head people (me = 7.25"" ear to ear)",474
3857,"My coworkers often make comments about my ""fancy headphones,"" but at this price I don't worry about leaving them at work overnight.",474
3858,Great little fella.,474
3859,Wont be disappointed it gets the job done.,474
3860,I was worried about the sound quality but there is bass and everything seems well balanced.,474
3861,These headphones... Wow.,474
3862,"But anyway, SO worth $20.",474
3863,I have used the bth220 model for the past year and love them but wanted a second pair.,474
3864,It is way worse with the Watch.,474
3865,Probably not ideal for kids but it still works.,474
3866,"I mainly use my headphones at the gym, watching videos on the elliptical machine and listening to music while working out.",474
3867,"What I would suggest the manufacturer for a future version is slightly better looks and amazing noice cancellation, I'd pay 60 dollars also!",474
3868,If it turns out that it is just my phone and it works great on other stuff then yeah I would suggest it.,474
3869,"These are listed for children, but fit my head perfectly, and the sound is great.",474
3870,Drowns out the crazies on my morning bus commute.,474
3871,He hasn't complained about it yet Its been over 1 month.,474
3872,"Once I hear that beep and plug them in for charging, it takes about 2 hours for a full charge.",474
3873,The video here is a video from my channel on YouTube -- ONOTech.,474
3874,"they are bulky around the neck when not on your ears, which i do not constantly wear them, on the ears.",474
3875,They Sound clear and loud.,475
3876,I'm totally used to them now.,475
3877,Like so many other reviews at $30 there is little room to nitpick; even if I get better headphones this will surely remain as a sportswear set.,475
3878,Bought these because a lot of people were giving them crazy good reviews saying they were amazing for the money.,475
3879,I have these in white and they are very good for what I need them.,475
3880,"So, my solution was to get wireless headphones.",475
3881,The flat sound and bulky earpieces ruin the headphone experience.,475
3882,"It's possible I just got a bad pair, but I suggest avoiding these anyway.",475
3883,I've used these for over a year now.,475
3884,I've used these for over a year now.,475
3885,better then what i expected i recommend this item they feel good look nice and they do not look cheap i give this item 5 stars got to me on time and really good,475
3886,"If you have it hooked up to a phone, and are listening to music, the music stops so you can listen to the call.",475
3887,But they are really a no go because they're just so uncomfortable to wear!,475
3888,"With such a short cord, the MDR-ZX100's are pretty much only suited for use with an mp3 player that you carry on you, or maybe with a computer desktop where the computer is directly in front of you (with the audio jacks up front).",475
3889,"I am changing the volume on the device, but it isn't in the perfect spot it was earlier.",475
3890,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,475
3891,I will continue to purchase these headphones whenever they wear out!,475
3892,I am very disappointed.,475
3893,"Either way, they're good enough for me.",475
3894,Just a very basic set of headphones.,475
3895,I'm in love with these things.,475
3896,Seem ambient enough.,475
3897,"If I'm wearing earrings, it's unbearable for even a minute, but even without, it feels very tight.",475
3898,yeah you can get beats for like a million bucks but why do that when these are just as good.,475
3899,"Had them for 3 weeks now, using them a couple of hours a day, 5 days a week and I just now had to charge them since my first charge.",475
3900,"Plug doesn't fit my macbook pro; too loose, keeps falling out.",476
3901,"The sound is crisp, bass is not drowning and it doesnt have hollow sound where voice and music sound separated.",476
3902,I have a small head for a guy and these are just big enough.,476
3903,They are comfortable.,476
3904,They sound phenomenal.,476
3905,"I like the easy connectivity, but what they are lacking is different audio settings.",476
3906,"Don't expect what you might hear from 200-300 dollar headphones, but these are well worth the money!",476
3907,Received the headphones as stated on the order.,476
3908,I had the older versions of this headset and they worked great and this one is no exception.,476
3909,"Listen to the reviews and you'll know that this is not for someone who wants ""top of the line"" quality and base pounding headphones.",476
3910,"I try 2wk s ago and love it but the draw back is the stereo sound quality, kind a not so loud to hear the music in a noisy work place.",476
3911,"Great little bluetooth headset, great price, extremely fast shipment, great battery life, and comfortable too.",476
3912,Somewhat comfy.,476
3913,I decided to buy a pair of over the ear headphones and saw these at a reasonable price.,476
3914,The only gripe would be the band is stiff and really really wide.,476
3915,They do a great job of blocking out external sound.,476
3916,"For the price, great deal.",476
3917,Not sure how long they will last as they feel flimsy;time will tell.,476
3918,I use these with my iPhone.,476
3919,"Next time, I'm going with the tried and true Shure headphones.",476
3920,It's more of a mechanical settle bass.,476
3921,I bought three pair because I like them so much.,476
3922,The sound is not that great but it matches many of 30 dlls headphones,476
3923,The reviews seemed pretty good so I gave them a try.,476
3924,I felt it was a great purchase for this price.,476
3925,I'm thinking there is a way to push a button or something to access the phone (Siri) but I have pressed all the buttons and still haven't been successful.,477
3926,These headphones are extremely uncomfortable to use for more than a few minutes at a time.,477
3927,"I purchased these headphones for my iPhone 5 and iPad, they were extremely easy to set up, they sound great and they are super comfortable on my head.",477
3928,I'm 5 foot 8 and I suspect my head is about average size for my height and they fit perfectly.,477
3929,The sound is very good.,477
3930,I've carried them in my Targus messenger bag for the past couple of months with ease.,477
3931,My head is not particular bigger the other people.,477
3932,Kinova has a complete line of products and a site for browsing and support.,477
3933,"I've had these headphones for less than six months and now the left side has blown out, for $25 I kind of expected more.",477
3934,She can wait until she is older for the headphones that cost 10 times the price.,477
3935,I had two of these... one stopped working after two months and the other still works but the mic doesn't work.,477
3936,"I owned a similar pair of Sony headphones about ten years ago, and for the price there is no better pair that you can get.",477
3937,They are definitely not tight around the head/ear but kind of feels like it's hanging down from my ear.,477
3938,"Hey Joel,

I like the earphones.",477
3939,Also the earcups are small and rest on top of the ears rather than covering them.,477
3940,Honestly should have just bought another pair of 220's.,477
3941,The chord isn't even compromised.,477
3942,Here's a hint: EQ them.,477
3943,They arrived quickly.,477
3944,These are great by any standard.,477
3945,The sound-quality when wearing them is clear and even works with bass-heavy* songs.,477
3946,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,477
3947,If you are looking for a great house phone Panasonic makes one with Bluetooth so you can charge your Smartphone and still talk.,477
3948,Audio keeps repeatedly cutting out when there's a slight movement (e.g.,477
3949,"they may be a bit ""old school"" but I have difficulty with the in the ear thingies  that come with phones and mp3 players.",477
3950,"Unfortunately, due to a terrible ear infection, I'm not supposed to be putting anything in my ears (including earbuds) for a very long time, if ever.",478
3951,I think they're pretty good considering I only paid about $30 for them.,478
3952,I doubt I'll need to any time soon.,478
3953,I have been wanting bluetooth headphones for my computer but didn't know how they worked.,478
3954,"I think if a person wants an average, inexpensive set set of headphones it would be hard to go wrong with these.",478
3955,A lot of reviews compared them to other higher end brand headphones which is unfair in my opinion.,478
3956,Bought some Sony wireless headphones for Christmas this year.,478
3957,"BTW, the 220's will still hold a charge perfectly.",478
3958,Can't believe they were as inexpensive as they were.,478
3959,"While they aren't advertised as sweat proof, I have sweated out buckets with these on and have had no effect on usage!",478
3960,I have a small head for a guy and these are just big enough.,478
3961,I have purchased these headphone earlier this week.,478
3962,"There is no adjustment for size, like some high-end (and high dollar) phones.",478
3963,I am a male with a neck size greater than 18 inches.,478
3964,We're totally satisfied with product .,478
3965,-connectivity issue.,478
3966,In fact just yesterday was the first time that it didn't but that was related to the adapter not the headphone.,478
3967,"For its price, this delivers very good sound.",478
3968,"They're also lightly made, so I won't be surprised if the padding wears out or something snaps, but for this price they're easily replaced.",478
3969,"This was accomplished by using the following steps:
Power off the headphones, Press + ,  and the Pairing button (center)  all 3 simultaneously for 6 seconds.",478
3970,"The price is so good, that I had trouble justifying paying the same amount for a protective case for them, so they won't get banged up in my backpack.",478
3971,"These are not the best headphones in the world, but they might just be the best $15 headphones in the world.",478
3972,The only issue I have ever had is after 5 years of continuous use and abuse the headband has become loose (grip wise) so when I bend down they have a tendency to start slipping off.,478
3973,So they work best when you only pair them to one device and are very careful not to push the wrong buttons.,478
3974,I go through headphones very quickly (three or four pairs in the last year).,478
3975,"They are light, they work, they fit my head, they have decent sound quality.",479
3976,This wasn't a bad sound--if you like blues and jazz this set would be good with that warm sound.,479
3977,They have been great!,479
3978,It's no longer so white but that is expected.,479
3979,I needed some new headphones when the old ones died.,479
3980,My previous experience with bluetooth devices seemed to have a larger range than that.,479
3981,Sound is great!,479
3982,We're totally satisfied with product .,479
3983,Owned these for a little over two years with light to moderate use through that time.,479
3984,I have them on now as I write this review.,479
3985,I find the ear piece to be very comfortable.,479
3986,I am very disappointed.,479
3987,"Well, when compared against my old Sony noise canceling ones, these are pathetic.",479
3988,Better volume and overall fit and finish than prior model.,479
3989,"Not noticeable at first, but you have to pay attention.",479
3990,"Contrary to other reviewers, I did not find them to be so comfortable for long periods.",479
3991,got these headphones in like february.,479
3992,I like this much better.,479
3993,"if i had to choose the price, i would price it at $34.99.",479
3994,The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the band is a little wide and I have a hard time to fit them well to my head.,479
3995,For the price i paid i was actually not expecting the quality that came out of the speaker.,479
3996,Sony's MDR-ZX100's are amazing.,479
3997,I listen to books on my 12 hour shift and often forget to charge it until it finally begins to die on the third day.,479
3998,"If you are a hi-fi head, you'll be disappointed with some of the range issues, but for the rest of us mere mortals, they are fantastic and give a true and clear sound.",479
3999,Spend a little more and buy something better.,479
0,"The new Apple earbuds stay in my ears pretty well, but the wire is a hassle during a workout.",480
1,I got this for an 2nd Gen Ipod Touch that has a problem with using the Amazon Basic keyboard (even though it's Blutooth).,480
2,The sound quality is great on the kinivo.,480
3,"After a day...
PROs: Comfortable headset (sure beats ear buds), good sound quality, easy to set up.",480
4,"Most importantly though, the price point is great and I can run, lift weights, and shoot hoops in these just fine.",480
5,cord is pretty thick for headphones in the price level and good strain relief near the ends that hopefully will give long and trouble free use.,480
6,so if you are looking for good audio that won't dent your wallet you can always count on these sony headphone to deliver.,480
7,"And for $20, you can't go wrong.",480
8,This means there's some degree of noise insulation.,480
9,"Battery last all day, it's great!",480
10,He blows through earbuds like they are nothing!,480
11,"Eventually, after falling to the ground and two years of general abuse they started to fail.",480
12,"sorry, slamming this with a one start because it takes a month to ship and no heads up on the description.",480
13,They come with a long cord which is convenient for the purpose of their use.,480
14,These headphones are amazing.,480
15,"They do get a little uncomfortable after extended wearing, but it's not a deal breaker.",480
16,Headphones relatively comfortable.,480
17,While these were cheap they also felt like it.,480
18,"They are moderately comfortable, but can get a bit painful when using them for a long period of time.",480
19,Not sure if this is a wake up call or a warning or something.,480
20,Excellent sound quality.,480
21,The second pair came in the mail worked great for a week.,480
22,"If the comfort were improved so I didn't have it hurting my ears, I would have no hesitation recommending it to others.",480
23,"Only trouble is, the white gets dirty very easily.",480
24,"For anyone that complains about the sound quality, THEY ARE $15.00.",480
25,Highly recommended!,481
26,Not expensive but works great.,481
27,"Cons: not really loud, its plastic, Earcups aren't really comfortable",481
28,Other than being a bit too large I love these headphones.,481
29,"If you have a head larger than a 5 year old kid, buy something else!!!",481
30,"Despite the sound and price, I don't recommend these headphones, due mostly on the design issues.",481
31,The headphone are not the best in the world or even top of the line.,481
32,also the controls are easy to access.,481
33,They've got no high end at all.,481
34,>>The covering over the ear-pads has ripped around the inside speaker.,481
35,"Other than that, they're fine.",481
36,I bought these because my cat was chewing the cords on my expensive in-ear noise-cancelling earphones.,481
37,Headphones exceeded my expectations!!!!,481
38,ALSO it came in black-not white.,481
39,"Don't drink and Drive unless your good at it, I used to be.",481
40,On Windows 8 it can be very difficult to figure out if you have bluetooth and how to turn it on.,481
41,The cord length is good.,481
42,This is still great after a year.,481
43,so why would i rate this thing 5 stars?,481
44,Love these Bluetooth Stereo Headphones.,481
45,The other loses connection often as it tries to connect to every device at once.,481
46,"The sound quality is also a 10, just enough bass.",481
47,Might have been expecting a little too much from Sony for the cost.,481
48,"And how the headphones fold up come in handy when on trips, to give me more room for other things.",481
49,He is absolutely in love with these.,481
50,I have purchased these headphone earlier this week.,482
51,The music comes back up at the volume level that you were listening to prior to the call.,482
52,"I had to run the last 3 miles without my auditory motivation, which I absolutely hated.",482
53,I will keep an eye but so far so good!,482
54,"Well, these dont... they're smaller than they look... they sit ON your ear, not OVER it.",482
55,"As I was saying, these headphones are fantastic because they are very light weight and good quality.",482
56,Because the headphone is not adjustable to your head i try to put the plastic piece over my ears which hurts after a while.,482
57,"The sound quality is good, blocks out other people who are also in the gym.",482
58,The pause works great.,482
59,My son wanted these so he got them.,482
60,They are light and pretty comfortable (very comfortable compared to ear-buds).,482
61,Probably not ideal for kids but it still works.,482
62,My biggest complaint is that I can't lay down with them on as the headband runs across the back of the head and is very uncomfortable to lie/lay on.,482
63,Microphone works well and can even be used with Siri.,482
64,I am an editor and I use these for simple editing in coffee shops.,482
65,"impressive range and sound...paired, worked easily out of the box.",482
66,"- Portability, the BTH240's fold up nicely and slip into the included cloth bag easily.",482
67,I purchased these in 2011 and are finally starting to reach the end of its life after 5 years of hardcore gym use and constant sweating in.,482
68,"All other affordable headphones have only lasted me a few months, so, needless to say, I was very pleased with this pair.",482
69,For me it was very loose even with it clinging on my ears.,482
70,These are great for driving and working in the yard when you don't want to be handling your phone.,482
71,Not the fault of the manufacturer.),482
72,I recommend these to all people,482
73,"The other set still function and work as expected, but extended high volume finally took its toll on the speakers.",482
74,"The sound quality is good, blocks out other people who are also in the gym.",482
75,They seem way more robust than the V150s too.,483
76,"I've purchased other headsets around this price point, and each has failed sooner than expected, in ways that seemed traceable to poor design, workmanship, or materials.",483
77,I don't even wear them anymore and I haven't even had them long because they were so uncomfortable.,483
78,"I listen to different kinds of music, pop, rap, instrumental, Polynesian, classical, etc.",483
79,"Dont come here and be a musician that whats super uber quality, I'm not a musican and I love them!",483
80,-connectivity issue.,483
81,The cord is very thick and can take a decent amount of stress so the wires are undamaged.,483
82,I got a pair of MDR-NC7 for about what I paid for the MDR-ZX100s I'm reviewing here.,483
83,"Thanks for reading,
ecl1pse
ecl1pse.bandcamp.com (I make music)",483
84,"They could be uncomfortable if you have glasses, as the frame could get pressed against your ear.",483
85,I went straight the amazon webpage and found that the Kinivo BTH240 would be a good fit for him.,483
86,Great headphones.,483
87,I had already purchased the Kinivo BTH3 headphones for at work and wanted an economical solution for those random times when I just want to get away from all the other noises at home and focus on my computer.,483
88,I road my bike around the neighborhood with them on and they shifted alot and I just couldn't get them to sit comfortably on my BIG head,483
89,"In fact, these exact ones.",483
90,I don't even wear them anymore and I haven't even had them long because they were so uncomfortable.,483
91,but on the good side it would match with your clothing quite nicely.,483
92,Then let's talk about how they make your ears sweat alot!,483
93,"Update 3 Sep 15

They stopped working about a week ago.",483
94,I'm glad that I did.,483
95,I've also recommended them to several at the office for conference calls on the laptops.,483
96,I use these for lectures and listening to music and it serves its purpose well.,483
97,Very disappointed!!,483
98,The sound is good enough for general listening.,483
99,"Sony did a great job on these...would buy another pair,for the price...you can't go wrong...",483
100,Only done side a little more bass would have been nice.,484
101,Thank you Kinivo for headphones that don't require charging after a few hours.,484
102,"The audio quality is superb, but that does not amount to much if you can't stand to wear them.",484
103,They come with a micro usb charging cable and a velvet-like pouch for storage.,484
104,The control buttons work smoothly and my iPhone 6 connected immediately and the calls are easy to answer and crystal clear.,484
105,These are fancy and cheap and got good sound quality.,484
106,I should have instead ordered the navy since white catches stains real fast.,484
107,"Arrived in good time, tried it with iPhone voice calls and with my music playlist.",484
108,Charging times are quick and charging is painless.,484
109,"The buttons are easily accessible, but they do sit flush with the hardware, so it's a little tough to tell if you're finger's in the right place if you're wearing gloves.",484
110,"You can feel the weight when you first put it on, depending how you run or work out it could jiggle around but the sound is great, I can hear the base and keep the beat while on the spin bike.",484
111,"In their backpacks to listen to music on the bus, at school for various classes, out of the backpack when they were home and countless times of falling asleep with them on, and rolling over onto them in their sleep.",484
112,These seem to have some static and a distinct lack of bass.,484
113,"I'm sure some people could care less about that, so take my review for what it is, my opinion.",484
114,I purchased the white one for my mother and it looks classy!,484
115,These broke after about 2 months of use.,484
116,"I mentioned that I used my TV - on the back it has a headphone out jack and I picked up a ""monoprice bluetooth splitter"" (those are your search words).",484
117,Very comfortable too.,484
118,Dollar for dollar you cant beat this product.,484
119,They worked great and lasted at least a year.,484
120,Now the right one is starting to go out as well.,484
121,"As I mentioned, these are not the headphones that you want if you are an audiophile seeking perfect sound, heavy bass response or noise cancelling capabilities.",484
122,I am so happy with these and I sleep quite well.,484
123,"These were very good headphones for a while, but after only 6 months, the sound on one side went out completely.",484
124,Once again Sony has proven to provide a good quality product for a very reasonable price.,484
125,"Also, the padding around the earpieces is quite comfortable and doesn't allow much sound leakage at all.",485
126,"I used to borrow the school's headphones, but I didn't like the idea of using something that hundreds of other students were using.",485
127,"I have used higher quality headphones, but they are usually too heavy for several hours of editing.",485
128,Bass was lacking and vocals seemed muffled.,485
129,It's not like the professional ones but it is great quality for the price and it may just last longer for me than my Behringer ones that only lasted a year and I payed more for!,485
130,It's neither good or bad.,485
131,"I am purchasing another pair today so I can have a dedicated unit for work, I am confident my old pair will continue to perform for the next year so in my locker they go!",485
132,He hasn't complained about it yet Its been over 1 month.,485
133,yeah you can get beats for like a million bucks but why do that when these are just as good.,485
134,I also wanted wireless because I didn't want to be tied to my iPad - I wanted to be able to move around and do things while listening.,485
135,"If you need a step up from earbuds but do they want to spend more money on a sound proof one, this is the one to buy.",485
136,"Had them for 3 weeks now, using them a couple of hours a day, 5 days a week and I just now had to charge them since my first charge.",485
137,I must say you can pay $20.00 more and get the bluetooth Nuclear A/V's off Amazon and be blown away by the sound quality.,485
138,"If you put these in a backpack or duffle, be extremely careful.",485
139,"Good for music and calls , do not recommend for work outs, they fit behind the head and have a tendency to fall off .",485
140,"Within 6 months, they started breaking.",485
141,"Overall I give this product a huge thumbs up on price, sound, and durability!!!",485
142,I've been using this to listen to movies I watch on Netflix on my nook.,485
143,My daughter is using them with her iPad and is very happy.,485
144,This set delivers in all aspects and lets me listen to my music without the whole house having to listen to it as well.,485
145,They fit so comfortably and nicely!,485
146,"So far, so good.",485
147,You won't regret it!,485
148,This headset sits slightly awkward during running but stays on for a while.,485
149,The sound is great and the battery life is decent.,485
150,"Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones.",486
151,Well the headphones weren't picking up on the sound when I was using it with any program on the PC.,486
152,My wife likes them a lot.,486
153,The price is very cheap for what they're worth.,486
154,Very impressed with how long they can go without a charge.,486
155,I use these pretty regularly and have had them for about a year.,486
156,Overall 4.5/5 compared to all headphones Ive ever owned which says alot!,486
157,I gave these 5-stars because they exceeded my expectations at any price.,486
158,I didn't expect that it will come earlier than I expected.,486
159,"Most importantly, the Kinivo earphones are comfortable for me while exercising.",486
160,"Next is the sound, which is very good.",486
161,Loud enough to hear over the mower and long enough to last a work day.,486
162,"Also, they didn't share room well with my glasses.",486
163,"The sound is slightly better than low-end to mid-range in ears or ear-buds, but surprisingly not by much.",486
164,They Sound clear and loud.,486
165,"yes for the price as many said, these are real nice but bottom line is the clarity wasn't close to even my flimsy apple airbuds so these are going back for that reason.",486
166,So I'll use them until they inevitably break...which they quickly will given the crappy cords they're equipped with...and then I'll go to Best Buy and purchase some more real ones at a higher price.,486
167,Been using it like 6 or 7 hours while I jog and no problem so far.,486
168,other than that they hold a long charge.,486
169,Very dissapointing!,486
170,"Even though, it isn't better than beats they still make AWESOME headphones!!",486
171,I'd buy them again if I needed a replacement anytime soon!,486
172,This headphone meets my expectation for its price.,486
173,The cord is long enough for me.,486
174,These headsets are awesome.,486
175,I did think that the range would be better.,487
176,I recently went running with these headphones on and yes it was charging the whole day.,487
177,I use it for watching movies on my ipad - not looking for the best quality audio for listening to music.,487
178,Perfect for working out.,487
179,"The MDR-ZX100 easily slips off your head, doesn't adjust tightly and sounds very low, no matter how high you turn your volume up.",487
180,Fortunately I still had my old ear buds so was able to make it through the movie.,487
181,I've looked at all the other Bluetooth headset on here and this one was my number one choice and #1 recommended.,487
182,I love these things.,487
183,"The only issue I've encountered is that I like to use this pair with multiple devices (phone/tablet/computer), and on occasion I have to repair.",487
184,They have been great!,487
185,"Used them on my droid but can play them very lound for some reason, i believe it is my phone though.",487
186,I use these pretty regularly and have had them for about a year.,487
187,"I used them for several hours every day, and only charge them up once a week.",487
188,Maybe it's supposed to do that for when you just want to let them hang around your neck but that certainly doesn't make them anymore comfortable.,487
189,When these break I will buy another pair.,487
190,I transcribe dictation at home and needed new headphones for my machine.,487
191,I use it for biking to work and listening to music or podcasts.,487
192,"But if you're like me and would rather not spend hundreds of dollars on headphones, these work just fine.",487
193,You can only hear the voices.,487
194,Pairing it to any bluetooth phone is easy.,487
195,"Despite their compact on-ear size, these are very big head friendly.",487
196,"We don't use them everyday but for the occassional use, they are just great and the price is terrific - for the money, you we think you can't go wrong!",487
197,I've used them regularly for several months now and am still pleased with the quality.,487
198,Sound not too bad though but won't recommend for training.,487
199,"Great battery life, strong Bluetooth reception with my phone.",487
200,We could hardly hear it.,488
201,I've bought three generations of these headphones.,488
202,Folds up to make it an easy carry.,488
203,I use this for my PC.,488
204,Then I realized it was supposed to be put on behind the neck.,488
205,Had a white pair that's lasted me 4+ years and bought this pair for my boyfriend because his previous pair from Zagg had a cord that broke after one year.,488
206,I told everyone I know about this product.,488
207,Other than that these have been excellent.,488
208,they still look great and put out a great level of sound.,488
209,Hope this review isn't to confusing and if you have questions please ask!,488
210,I like that they don't pinch and still stays on when I run or mountain bike.,488

214,I didn't use them every day maybe 2-3 times a week.,488
215,"If you want some over the head earphones and you don't want to spend more than 30 dollars, these are a must buy.",488
216,It's not very comfortable either.,488
217,Then I realized it was supposed to be put on behind the neck.,488
218,"yes for the price as many said, these are real nice but bottom line is the clarity wasn't close to even my flimsy apple airbuds so these are going back for that reason.",488
219,Great little fella.,488
220,The frequency response was terrible.,488
221,I purchased these expecting them to be comfortable and have better than normal sound.,488
222,"So, these are decent for the price and for style which is what I prefer (ie neckband with full ear muff).",488
223,They work perfect with my iphone.,488
224,I would not buy again.,488
225,These are terribly uncomfortable.,489
226,Decent earphones for a fair price.,489
227,The biggest pro so far is that they are quite comfortable.,489
228,The bass is just awesome.,489
229,"I bought the new one because I lost the other ones again, and I wanted a separate pair for work.",489
230,It's a bit of a challenge for me to get the bands hooked over my ears.,489

237,I finally decided to look on Amazon and these looked highly recommended and for $25 I didn't think I was taking much of a risk.,489
238,I am so glad I made this purchase!,489
239,Excellent value for your dollar.,489
240,Don't know what the big deal is for the expensive ones.,489
241,"Have only had these a few days but initial impressions are ""pretty"" good.",489
242,They are very easy to pair with an iPad so that I can listen to iTunes or Spotify through my iPad without disturbing my wife.,489
243,got these headphones in like february.,489
244,"Honestly, I had never heard of Kinivo, but after trying them I found them to be comfortable AND capable of withstanding some sweat.",489
245,And by the time I realized this I was out of the return window.,489
246,It use this as my main set but they are good value.,489
247,He states that the quality of sound is very good coming from the headphones and I tried them as well and I actually like them a lot better than my J Lab in ear headphones.,489

249,This last pair has lasted for over a year.,489
250,"Nice design, they fit very well and are very confortable,  great sound, easy to vinculate to my iPhone and tablet, the controls on the headphone work great and the range of connection is great.",490

255,"I wish they had a better grip though, as in a month they started to fall down if I picked something up.",490
256,Can't believe these were so highly rated.,490
257,"For less than 20 dollars, SONY is SONY.",490
258,"I would suggest buying these first, they're great for classical music, rock, and metal.",490
259,"These are not the best headphones in the world, but they might just be the best $15 headphones in the world.",490
260,"This is an un-necessary glitch for  what I previously considered the best portable blue-tooth headphones, including the unilateral  in-ear-piece models, I have ever owned.",490
261,"They are very comfortable and they are Sony, a name brand.",490
262,Color: Black I have purchased 3 of these and one has lasted for several years.,490
263,These headphones are budget friendly.,490
264,"I have a large head, and it fits me really well.",490
265,So after eliminating issues with the devices it only leave the headphones.,490

270,"Purchased for my teenager who knew she wasn't going to get the $200 headphones, and she's very pleased with them.",490
271,"So, I figured since I was happy with Sony, that would be the place to look.",490
272,I got a pair of Sony headphones about 10 years ago that are a lot better than these and only cost me $7.99.,490
273,Pairing is very easy.,490
274,"The thing I love is that there very durable, My little nephew bash them 2 times with a baseball bat, and not a single scratch!",490
275,"Overall these are the best pair of Stereo Bluetooth headphones I've ever used and I've tried Plantronics, Motorola 305's and Sony.",491
276,"Note that these are the sports-type of headphones, and instead of going over the top of the head, they go behind the neck.",491
277,They fit pretty well around my ear and have no issues with them falling off when lifting weights or running on a treadmill.,491
278,My eight and six year old got them for Christmas and they use them all of the time.,491

281,I bought this back in 2014 for school and just to relax with.,491
282,"The fit is comfortable, the volume doesnt get as loud as you would like but for the price it was a good investment for bluetooth since I cant stand wired headphones.",491
283,Mediocre product and performance.,491
284,I purchased the LG tone pro afterward and was diss appointed because they were twice as expensive and half the quality.,491
285,Kinivo BTTH240 Bluetooth Headphone is the excellence one.,491
286,All three are in great working condition and my kids do a good job of working them.,491
287,"The noise cancellation was much better than I thought it would be, so definite props for that on low price headphones.",491
288,Sometimes it works fine.,491
289,All ambient noise will leak in and all noises created by the headphones will leak out.,491
290,These aren't anything special.,491
291,I bought the Jabra because they can support 2 devices at one time.,491
292,"Since these are on-ear headphones and are not noise cancelling, they do not really keep outside noise out, especially if you're on a plane or around noisy people.",491
293,Due to the headphones being smaller than my head I feel that the joints of these three pieces that make up the headband are going to snap on me as they do not feel durable.,491
294,The small carrying bag is a plus and thank you for including the USB charging cable.,491
295,"I use them with my iPad, iPhone, laptop and desktop units and they work perfectly, but sometime moving from one device to another can be a bit tricky, but attainable once you get used to them. . . .  bgs.",491

299,"Sound in both ears is clear, they're comfortable for long periods of time, i've dropped them on numerous occasions and the plastic hasn't cracked or really scuffed at all.",491
300,I suggest getting a warranty.,492
301,I highly recommend!,492
302,Best blutooth headphones I've purchased.,492
303,Four stars includes value/affordability factors.,492
304,I would not buy again.,492
305,For only 15-20$ you absolutely cannot go wrong.,492

307,I use these for lectures and listening to music and it serves its purpose well.,492
308,Sounds good but the fit is little tight for my head.,492
309,Which is why the 4  stars instead of 5.,492
310,"It also can't seem to communicate properly with my iphone, so that the phone constantly flips over to loudspeaker mode.",492
311,Works great to talk through as well.,492
312,I've only had the headphones about a week.,492
313,"Very pleased, especially for the price.",492
314,"Durable, great quality.",492
315,Be careful handling them until you figure how they unfold out and fold up... as they're fragile compared to Sony MDR700V's.,492
316,"When I saw the picture, I expected a bigger pair of headphones.",492
317,I have not had this frustrating experience with any other bluetooth headphones on the same devices.,492
318,"The only real downside is the cord length is short, which I knew about in advance - not an issue for me because I keep my pc on the desk where it should be.",492
319,"They do get minorly uncomfortable after about an hour straight of them being on, but then again what headphones don't!",492
320,Great sound quality.,492
321,I like the fact that I can lay the ear muff flat so I can just slip it my computer case.,492
322,These are great for driving and working in the yard when you don't want to be handling your phone.,492
323,"I just received these in the mail a couple of days ago so I can't write about how long they last or anything like that, but I can say that I absolutely love them especially for the price.",492
324,"Once I hear that beep and plug them in for charging, it takes about 2 hours for a full charge.",492
325,Sound is actually pretty good.,493
326,I love the way it sounds and feels.,493

329,I do find these more comfortable for all day wear than every other pair of headphones that I've owned.,493
330,I used them all day long for conference calls while I walk around my office untethered.,493
331,The sound is great and the battery life is decent.,493
332,I needed a cheap pair of head phones that I was hoping would give decent sound.,493
333,This way I can set my phone at a central location where I am working out and keep listening to tunes.,493
334,The headset came nicely packaged and there was a USB charging cable provided.,493
335,My happiness scale goes all the way up when I listen to music through these.,493
336,I do recommend this product if you just need some basic bluetooth head gear.,493
337,"The last time this happened, I turned the headphones off and on again, which fixed the issue.",493
338,"The sound these headphones deliver, for a quarter of the price of my Grados, is fantastic.",493
339,Best headphones I've ever had and so inexpensive.,493
340,"The sound on these are better than Apple headphones, I can assure you of that.",493
341,I BOUGHT A 2ND SET FOR MY WIFE TO PRACTICE HER GUITAR THRU A SMALL AMP AND SHE LOVES THEM AS WELL.,493
342,This last pair has lasted for over a year.,493
343,They work perfect with my iphone.,493
344,"Headband pads can be bought, but the hot water pipe insulation was all I had available at the time.",493
345,"volume is great, although I cannot hear much when I am in the subway due to the noise but for the price I am very happy.",493
346,Price comparable to lesser models seen at Wal-Mart and the like.,493
347,They are awesome!,493
348,These have a small flashing blue paired light and not even noticeable.,493
349,"This headset is no disappointment very comfortable to ware (I have big head and I will usually feel pressure on my head after 4 hours of wearing it, pretty good compare to 2 hours or less when I wear my other expensive pare)

Highly recommend.",493
350,"She liked that they were easy to put on, and the price.",494
351,"Sony logo does wear out after couple of months, regular wear and tear.",494
352,The ear cups are a little small for me.,494
353,Especially for those looking for a set of headphones to be used while exercising or running.,494
354,came securely and professionally packaged.,494
355,"The audio quality, however, was more akin to the $3 headphones that you get on an airplane to watch a movie, and those headphones are meant to be disposable.",494
356,"For the price of these headphones, they're actually pretty good.",494
357,"Daughter's gave out a week ago, so they lasted about 8 months.",494
358,"For the price of this set, I'd give it my approval.",494
359,"Very sturdy, stays on your head.",494
360,"In hindsight, I should have stepped up the extra $13 and purchased the Koss R10.",494
361,If you can find the right sized replacement.,494
362,But these are wonders.,494
363,Highly recommended.,494
364,I'm going to put a piece of tape over it and hopefully that solves the problem.,494
365,I do occasionally get static when I'm downtown as if a stronger signal just temporarily overwhelmed my bluetooth connection and I have to back up 30 seconds on my audiobook to hear what I missed.,494
366,"And for $20, you can't go wrong.",494
367,I was also able to tolerate the behind-the-neck - it only bothers me when I try to stretch my head and neck back which I can live with (although I think I will try top-of-the-head phones next).,494
368,cord does not tangle.,494
369,The hearing quality of this headset is good but they fit loose on my ears.,494
370,They are reasonably light and nicely padded around the ears.,494
371,I get great signal in the room I lift in and even a few rooms over through walls.,494
372,These headphones were purchased for my wife and I.,494
373,"So as long as you are not not using them in that situation, they work great and they are comfortable.",494
374,So let's just say they could be more comfortable when your head is lying on a pillow.,494
375,I'm also a musician (bass) and  I think the music quality is very good.,495
376,We use the new set for audio and phone calls only.,495
377,I didn't think the fit was right for me.,495
378,I was a little worried that these would be junk... but they are awesome.,495
379,I have to reconnect it at least 10 times a day.,495
380,You just can't complain at this price.,495
381,"I'm a college student with limited transportation options, so none of the return policies would even be worth the money for this garbage.",495
382,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,495
383,"Over the years I used to spend about $20 every two months on earphones that get caught in spokes, suffer water damage, get frayed, experience impact damage, or just generally short out or stop functioning.",495
384,"The noise cancellation was much better than I thought it would be, so definite props for that on low price headphones.",495
385,These are still working for me.,495
386,Arrived very quickly.,495
387,I just like to have one for giggles and grins.,495
388,"Most importantly, the Kinivo earphones are comfortable for me while exercising.",495
389,The cord is perfect for me but that is because I am short so the cord is not super long for me.,495
390,"I honestly got these as a secondary pair, when I don't feel like using or lending anyone my Bose.",495
391,"If you want some over the head earphones and you don't want to spend more than 30 dollars, these are a must buy.",495
392,These are very nice.,495
393,"After four years of use, I have not once regretted purchasing these headphones.",495
394,I've never really counted how long the duration of a single charge is but I'd like to say around 8 hours!,495
395,I've had these headphones for about 7 months and I love them.,495
396,I kept getting the cord of the cable wrapped around my chair or hooked on something.,495
397,"When they work, they're fine, but they seem to lose their charge too quickly.",495
398,I guess since they cover the ears they really block out a decent amount of outside noise leaving just music.,495
399,This product works fantastic.,495
400,"When you listen to any song, you can occasionally hear background instruments or percussion very well, this can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the way you view your music.",496
401,"To my surprise, they sounded pretty good for $15.",496
402,I let them know what the problem was and they had it fixed w/i 3 days.,496
403,"The sound is great, almost complete noise canceling.",496
404,"During a workout, my music will gradually lower to min volume and then start beeping (because it hit the volume min limit).",496
405,I'd give it 5 stars for sound and comfort.,496
406,I just picked up the SONY MDR-ZX100 headphones today and for the small amount I paid I can't believe the big sound I am getting with them.,496
407,Great sound and hopefully durable for the long haul!,496
408,These are decent quality.,496
409,"They are adjustable, they look great, fit great.",496
410,Each charge gives about 2 days worth of listening.,496
411,Other than being a bit too large I love these headphones.,496
412,It is compatible with Apple products.,496
413,they would be fine.,496
414,It also appears that the noise cancellation logic struggles when the input signal is low.,496
415,Buy this headphone!,496
416,I recieved the headphones very quickly...,496
417,Not to loud either so you don't blow the cones out of them lol.,496
418,"I am going to look into investing in another brand, ANY OTHER BRAND.",496
419,"The playback controls work well in Android, but only work in native apps on Windows Surface, not in web apps.",496
420,I gave this a 4 star because when walking outside I sometimes lose the connection.,496
421,"Anyway I was looking for the dj style that covers the ears and provide at least some noise reduction, for under 20 doll-hairs.",496
422,"You can bring these up to passable by boosting the treble, but if you're using a device that has no EQ control beyond bass boost they're going to sound very muffled

The insulating pads.",496
423,"For example, if I put my phone in my front left pocket and walk then the connection has a tendency to break up in time to my steps.",496
424,I bought 2 more after I bought the first one.,496
425,I'm just a reg joe and I also have a pair of boss and a pair of beats.... but I use these for work and I bring them home so the kids use.....,497
426,"The bass, treble both are excellent.",497
427,They get fairly loud and Don't distort at high volume.,497
428,"However, my son loves them.",497
429,"Though I did receive comments on the receiving end that it was a bit soft, and with Skype Echo testing it sounded fine to me (although a bit flat, but I am not planning on using this mic for any karaoke).",497
430,I love these!!!,497
431,The only negative is the material around the headphones has started to peel off.,497
432,"Pros:
> The speakers can swivel and rest flat.",497
433,"My PC with Windows 8, allows me to chose my default sound source, either computer speakers, or the Kinivo headset.",497
434,"It keeps cutting out, or warbling distortedly.",497
435,You won't be disappointed.,497
436,I've had this for about 3 weeks now and I freaking love it!,497
437,"The audio quality is good, especially considering the fact that they only cost $20 on average.",497
438,Bought some Sony wireless headphones for Christmas this year.,497
439,These lasted me a good year and half before they gave out on me :( They were amazing for the price and will be sorely missed.,497
440,I would recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of headphones for a good price even if he/she is not using them for running or other activities.,497
441,I love good bass and these guys deliver without being overpowering.,497
442,"(walls being in the way seem to be the biggest issue...)

overall, i'd recommend these to anyone looking for a round-the-back style bluetooth headset.",497
443,My son also eecieved Beats headphones for Christmas and prefers these..,497
444,This last pair has lasted for over a year.,497
445,Can't wear for more than a few minutes unless I only keep it on one ear.,497
446,*Bluetooth connectivity was a breeze (I have a Pantech Marauder android phone that found the head phones in 5 seconds).,497
447,Husband loves them really good working.,497
448,I can now use my phone charger instead of having to locate my old phone charger and have two chargers.,497
449,Guess these might not be all that cool I guess I really don't know but if you are a pork and beaner and looking for about the best $30 dollar item in the whole world this may very well be it.,497
450,They are also very easily adjusted and can be changed around to fit your individual measurement.,498
451,"Be aware though the cord is around 3', so you'll need to either buy an extension if you need a longer distance or buy another brand entirely.",498
452,Keep looking guys & gals.,498
453,I looked at the manufacturer's photos and I am wearing them properly.,498
454,I wish their quality control was better.,498
455,I don't take these outside and I barely use it indoors.,498
456,The backbone of the headset rests behind your head on your neck.,498
457,"These were very good headphones for a while, but after only 6 months, the sound on one side went out completely.",498
458,I would recommend these to anyone looking for bluetooth headphones at a decent price.,498
459,They stay in place while running and can get loud enough to block out surrounding noise.,498
460,"I also have been using it at the gym for about 2 hours at a time, it handles great.",498
461,The red light will go on for just a couple of minutes and then go off..,498
462,They are well built and have held up to anything I have put them through.,498
463,"They're small and would be a great size for a child, the sound quality is ok, it sounds a bit low and the bass isn't much, it doesn't sound like the 20$ sony headphones, this pair would be a step down from that.",498
464,In the past I' ve had to throw away more expensive headsets because it felt like my jaw was in a vice.,498
465,The Panasonic RP-HT21 is head and shoulders above the Sony MDRZX100.,498
466,I like the state as arrival at their destination.,498
467,I found these particular headphones to be very uncomfortable.,498
468,These are great for any  music of mine!,498
469,"My son loves this product, and it helps us not have to listen to him playing his video games on his computer.",498
470,I do occasionally get static when I'm downtown as if a stronger signal just temporarily overwhelmed my bluetooth connection and I have to back up 30 seconds on my audiobook to hear what I missed.,498
471,Not to mention they look pretty snazzy.,498
472,(dollar store headphones) I could make out much less of the audio than I could with my existing headphones.,498
473,Just a note ...,498
474,"We are very actively involved with exercising at the y every day and
use these wireless to listen to music as we exercise.",498
475,The sound quality isn't so good but the looks and brand name of Sony alone make up for it.,499
476,"Most have written long reviews about Sonys cheap alternative, I am going to keep it short.",499
477,"the small hole in my mac which apple calls as ""speaker"" sounds better than this.",499
478,I remember how much I loved the first pair I bought so I decided to purchase them again to compliment my droid incredible.,499
479,Getting another pair only because I can't find my first pair!,499
480,"I have an above-average size head, I'm a husky 6'-2"", but come on, I'm no freak - the product should at least be adjustable to fit me.",499
481,"They gave me a bit of a headache when I first starting using them, but it was so worth it.",499
482,"They're priced cheap, another plus.",499
483,One charge lasts basically all day.,499
484,"In terms of sound, I'd say that they are about the same quality.",499
485,Another thing I noticed is that they aren't really loud.,499
486,This is my 2nd pair of BTH240 headphones.,499
487,It syncs with my Galaxy Note 3 easily allowing me freedom from wires.,499
488,Would order from again.,499
489,I didn't use them every day maybe 2-3 times a week.,499
490,Don't buy these.,499
491,I purchased these headphones for my mom to use with her iPad and she absolutely loves it.,499
492,"(about 48 inches long)
The sound quality is decent, not professional quality obviously but not that horrible flat sound you get with many ear buds.",499
493,I cut the sleeve down the side to see the plug area and it had it's wires sticking out of the hole in it's side.,499
494,This headset is excellent except for the muffled at times when i talk to someone.,499
495,"Here's the pros/cons:

PROS:
-Sound is actually really good, definitely blocks out all of the gym noise.",499
496,This was a good buy.,499
497,This was even better then the original one I had .,499
498,Pleased with the durability and reasonable price.,499
499,I wasn't expecting a whole lot for $25 so I am pleasantly surprised.,499
500,I really look forward to the times when there isn't a lot of background noise and I get to put these on.,500
501,After this experience I decided to purchase another pair of 220's which I also enjoyed very much before my original pair failed.,500
502,"if i had the chance and some extra cash, i will eventually switch to something more comfortable that i can wear for a long period for work.",500
503,"Rather than sticking straight out of the laptop, this plug inserts into the laptop socket and lies along the edge of the laptop.",500
504,"That being said, I needed these for listening to lectures and classes online and didn't want to put much money into it.",500
505,crackles and bucks a bit.,500
506,I use them everyday in the gym.,500
507,Very comfortable too.,500
508,I just got these in the mail.,500
509,"Someone suggested buying a pair of headphones instead of IEM's, and I was in a target one day ruiing the loss of my earbuds and bought these.",500
510,They are moderately comfortable but I would not wear them for more than an hour or so.,500
511,"If you have it hooked up to a phone, and are listening to music, the music stops so you can listen to the call.",500
512,They could even add $2 to the price without ruining the great value of them.,500
513,I use it for biking to work and listening to music or podcasts.,500
514,I wear X-Large hats so have a large head but these headphones are comfortable for a few hours wear.,500
515,Does not drop signal continuously.,500
516,Those without such issues or not looking for any noise blocking qualities will love these headphones.,500
517,These Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones are good.,500
518,The first one was for my child's schools needs.,500
519,"My complaints are mostly about how they are built:  The cord is extremely short, even shorter than the MDR-V150, and it's taking some getting used to.",500
520,Provides descent quality sound and are durable.,500
521,Not sure if this is a wake up call or a warning or something.,500
522,That didn't help.,500
523,"After over two years they finally broke on me, one side stopped working.",500
524,"It's being utilized during walks, dish washing, gardening, snowshoveling.",500
525,Highly recommended!,501
526,- They're adjustable.,501
527,Here's a hint: EQ them.,501
528,"The sound is crisp, bass is not drowning and it doesnt have hollow sound where voice and music sound separated.",501
529,"For those that never tried a pair of middle to upper grade headphones, these are sure to delight.",501
530,I love having buttons on the side so I don't need to be next to my phone.,501
531,I was a bit disappointed I had a pair of the MDRZX100 and wanted another pair since my first messed up.,501
532,for someone who is really clumsy and is used to breaking headphones all the time this is perfect.,501
533,"Pros:
-Well built
-Good price

Cons:
-Wire randomly twists after normal use

the wires twist into themselves after using them for only a few days.",501
534,I have no idea how but there is really no way to untwist it.,501
535,They work perfect with my iphone.,501
536,I mostly wear these for work sitting at a desk and listening to audiobooks.,501
537,"No more charge, no more factory reset.",501
538,After two days of having them the right side of the headphones stopped working.,501
539,the sound quality is adequate for this purpose.,501
540,I like how they came with a travel pouch/ bag.,501
541,I love these headphones.,501
542,The music sounds very clear and the sound quality is great.,501
543,The bad: Maybe I have bigger ears but sometimes they take some fiddling to get comfortable on my head.,501
544,Built quality is sub par and very disappointing emotions.,501
545,"Pros: easy to connect, clear connection, compact

Cons: not tight enough on my ears nor my husband's therefore does not block out much background noise/other music at the gym

Overall, I am disappointed.",501
546,"They work fine for music, but for you tube or vine DO NOT use these they are laggy and uncomfortable to wear.",501
547,However the ear piece is really soft so that balance out the tight grip.,501
548,I love the sound these have and they are almost as good as what I had with the Walkman that I purchased almost 2 years ago.,501
549,Sometimes it works fine.,501
550,I'm rough on headphones.,502
551,The wiring by the headphone jack is getting a bit frayed on the inside so sometimes the sound is spotty but I'm not surprised.,502
552,"The MDR-ZX100 easily slips off your head, doesn't adjust tightly and sounds very low, no matter how high you turn your volume up.",502
553,"I have spent the past few months looking for a cheap bluetooth option because when the family is at home, and I'm on the treadmill watching whatever on the TV, I can listen to it without disturbing them.",502
554,I'm just reviewing so the average Joe can know that these headphones are worth the $15 and that it is a great purchace.,502
555,I even got a hug 3 days ago from the 9 year old for buying them.,502
556,"Given the price, this should be expected.",502
557,Bought them as gifts for directors who were competing at a marching band event and they loved them!!!,502
558,"I use them with my iPad, iPhone, laptop and desktop units and they work perfectly, but sometime moving from one device to another can be a bit tricky, but attainable once you get used to them. . . .  bgs.",502
559,I've had them or almost a year & there has been no major breakdown or issues.,502
560,"The only downside is the lack of microphone, and fact that they don't fold up as nicely as other pairs.",502
561,I find the slimmer BTH240 is more attractive and offers controls that are more user-friendly.,502
562,"They are cheap and produce good, clear sound into your ears.",502
563,The problem is they feel too small for my fat head and they are not adjustable.,502
564,Ordered for my nephew.,502
565,"This is my 2nd pair, the sound quality, comfort, and overall feel is just second to none for the very affordable price.",502
566,"It's OK if you are listening to loud music, but for softer stuff not so much.",502
567,I was very impressed.,502
568,"When I listen to all my favorite song's the  sound's on this Sony stereo headphone's are great you can hear the music more,it tune's out any other sound around you.",502
569,My wife has been using BTH 220 for 2 years without any issue so i decided to order the newer version.,502
570,"Even if these broke, I would probably invest in a second pair.",502
571,"Good range, love not being tethered to my phone, and can still listen to my music from two rooms away.",502
572,The button changes don't improve or worsen my review.,502
573,I would personally recommend these headphones.,502
574,"Only trouble is, the white gets dirty very easily.",502
575,Just got back from a 2100 mile road trip and these held up to abuses of 3 young boys tossing them around the car for 2 weeks!,503
576,"In sum, it's a great deal.",503
577,I've only had the headphones about a week.,503
578,I got this in white for my girlfriend and she really loves them.,503
579,It's easy to set up and having all the controls on one of headphones is a big plus.,503
580,This headphone is the bomb.,503
581,"I like the sound quality, it has good tones and the bass is pretty good too, something that I love to hear in my music.",503
582,"The pads were much bigger, and there was the padding at the top too.",503
583,They sit very lightly on my rather large head.,503
584,"Arrived in good time, tried it with iPhone voice calls and with my music playlist.",503
585,So far very happy with them.,503
586,It isn't surround-sound quality.,503
587,Highly recommend.,503
588,I purchased these to use as hands free calling.,503
589,I bought it almost one year ago and have been wearing them to gym and outdoor cycling.,503
590,And there was no way to adjust them so they would stay.,503
591,"However both clips have broken and I've had to duct-tape them back into place -- next stop, Krazy Glue.",503
592,"Additionally, there appears to be a type of AVL (volume limiter) built into this product.",503
593,"It's not as long as my last set of headphones, which would probably be good for someone using them for anything other than what I use them for, which is sitting at my computer.",503
594,Also no static at all.,503
595,"The 240 has improved control options, but oddly less range for higher volume?",503
596,The greatest pair of cheap headphones.,503
597,Sound is actually pretty good.,503
598,"These are really affordable headphones, nice and loud with decent bass.",503
599,15% Discount gets you 1000 sales.,503
600,"I purchased high end pair, the ear pad connector broke conveniently a week after warranty ran out.",504
601,I checked out the Amazon reviews and also noticed that thewirecutter.com gave them a very good review.,504
602,They're super durable.,504
603,I saved a ton of money and the headphones audio is superb!,504
604,They look great and connect easily.,504
605,"Up until last night, I was really kind of bragging about how great the second set had been.",504
606,I took a chance and it paid off.,504
607,I bought 2 pairs of head phone for a long trip to Asia.,504
608,The shipping was fast and product as described.,504

612,"When using to talk on a phone call, they have great clarity and work very well.",504
613,I use these earphones primarily for watching TV while exercising at the gym or to listen to video clips on the computer.,504

615,"If you want good headphones for a good price,You can't go wrong with these stylish headphones from Sony.",504
616,They are so convenient for when he is working he can listen to his music and answer phone calls with just one click without having to take out his phone and answer the call or change songs!,504
617,"They are super comfortable, I can wear them for hours and hours and not even notice them.",504
618,Use them to work out at the gym.,504
619,I recommend these most highly.,504
620,"Things with lots of bass (movies, dance music) have good punch.",504
621,Perfect for travelers who are looking for fewer wires to mess with while lounging at the airport.,504
622,No bass to speak of.,504
623,I also use them to watch Netflix on my iPad and it paired easily with my iPad 4th generation.,504
624,After a lot of research I decided to try these.,504
625,"Of course, this wasn't strictly managed by my phone.",505
626,I didn't use them every day maybe 2-3 times a week.,505
627,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,505
628,They exert some kind of pressure on my ears.,505
629,- They're adjustable.,505
630,I tested these headphones on both my iPod touch and my PC and they both play beautifully but if you want it for use on your computer note that the cord is no more than two feet of extra cord.,505
631,"Now they are probably a little bigger than what you think, but they fit nice around your ears, and provide some noise cancellation because of that.",505
632,Got these for my son for school and they work great.,505
633,I would recommend them to anyone looking for a pair of headphones for a good price even if he/she is not using them for running or other activities.,505
634,Can be comfortably worn for about 3 hours before the ear cushioning becomes flat and starts to hurt ear cartilage.,505
635,"Im the kind of person that only uses earbuds but i got this because of the low price and how they look....But OMG when they came i was so happy,they work great,they are awesome!",505
636,"We don't use them everyday but for the occassional use, they are just great and the price is terrific - for the money, you we think you can't go wrong!",505
637,"i was discussed with the sound quality of these headphones, Sony dropped the ball on these.",505
638,This product is replacing my previous 4 year old SteelSeries Siberia V2.,505
639,The flat sound and bulky earpieces ruin the headphone experience.,505
640,Discomfort sets in after a few hours (I've been streaming a lot of Breaking Bad).,505
641,"I have used them on a run, several times at the gym and to walk my dog.",505
642,Bought these for my wife.,505
643,Very dissapointing!,505
644,"I don't know if something in the vicinity interferes with the connection or what, but I think the convenience of having a bluetooth headset outweighs the few hickups every now and then.",505
645,"I'm a college student with limited transportation options, so none of the return policies would even be worth the money for this garbage.",505
646,I listen to Rap/Hip-hop and Metal/core/screamo style music.,505
647,"I wouldn't recommend them for DJing or producing, since they do not at all have ""Studio Quality"" sound.",505
648,These came to me broken and I think that stands as a testament to the poor build quality on these headphones.,505
649,These little headphones are great so far!,505
650,"As for quality of material and comfort, I would like to give these headphones a 4 out of 5 on quality of material.",506
651,A co-worker just bought a set for herself.,506
652,"The headphones work with the tablet these were purchased for, what else can you ask for.",506
653,I purchased the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo headphones specifically for walking/running while wearing sunglasses.,506
654,Very inconvenient.,506
655,Buy this headphone!,506
656,"Sound quality is clear if you don't need any true base, but overall they feel very cheap for Sony Headphones.",506
657,"I usually don't take the time to review things, but this product is an exception I feel that these headphone comparing them to beats on display at the store are almost better.",506
658,"Pros:
> The speakers can swivel and rest flat.",506
659,I'm returning them and will investigate if it was just a manufacturing issue.,506
660,These headphones are fine for a normal sized person like my little wifey.,506
661,The battery life is great and easily lasts a full 8 hour day at work.,506
662,"They arrived quickly, are simple and intuitive to use and sound good and last a good while before needing to be recharged.",506
663,They do make my ears sweaty but I prefer sweat over using little ear buds as I find them terribly uncomfortable.,506
664,I bought them because reviews on amazon said they were of the same quality of Beats by Dre.,506
665,I would have returned it but due to my own fault I purchased them and didn't open the box until after the return window was closed.,506
666,I'm the type who I crank up my music and just dive into what I'm doing.,506
667,I still hate using them.,506
668,I bought for my son to use during the time he watches the IPAD but it didn't last long enough.,506
669,"They were easy to connect to my iPad, and sound good and have pretty good range.",506
670,This product is replacing my previous 4 year old SteelSeries Siberia V2.,506
671,I have dropped them once or twice and they still work.,506
672,"Under $20 though, I'm not complaining.",506
673,Unfortunately i have gone through 2 pairs of these and both no longer work within 2-3 months of using them 5-6 days a week.,506
674,"They are comfortable, and you can't beat the price.",506
675,"Probably needless to say, the Bose OE2 lightweight headphones, also top rated by Consumer Reports, sound the best.",507
676,The fact that the ear pieces rotate so they can store flat is a great feature.,507
677,"I had just lost some pretty good headphones, but I wasn't really interested in an investment.",507
678,Highly recommended.,507
679,Connection to my laptop was seamless.,507
680,I've had these headphones for over a year and the battery life is still great.,507
681,"2.  not a huge problem, but the 240's are thinner than the 220's by a good margin.",507
682,"Clear, high quality sound and sturdy construction.",507
683,Even though the functionally a good  the build quality is not sturdy.,507
684,Great headphones for what I need them for and for the price.,507
685,I readjust how they sit every once in a while.,507
686,"I use these at work every day while I program, and I have no complaints.",507
687,"If you need a pair for only 1 year, these are fine but don't expect to use them for 3 or more years, because they will disintegrate on your head",507
688,"Cons
- Slight rattle - I own a couple of pairs of these headphones.",507
689,Had them for only about a few weeks and they are busted....just buy something else.,507
690,"As many said in other review,  these headphones are a bit large.",507
691,This product delivers and so much more.,507
692,Only item I didn't like was that the headstrap is not adjustable.,507
693,I would purchase these again.,507
694,"They're priced cheap, another plus.",507
695,I wear glasses and its just a quick adjustment when putting them on to compensate for over the ear wearing.,507
696,I cut the sleeve down the side to see the plug area and it had it's wires sticking out of the hole in it's side.,507
697,But the Sont MDRZX100's have really good sound quality.,507
698,The only problem is they should use a better quality covering over the foam ear muffs.,507
699,Great sound for the price.,507
700,Headphones fit my head.,508
701,"They have a decent bass sound but it is lacking in that deep rumble, however it does sound very good.",508
702,"Battery last for months with a single charge (I use five to six times a week during one hour) Regarding connectivity is very easy to pair and once paired, it connects very easy to my iphone with a single touch.",508
703,It has pretty long range too?,508
704,Used them for about 3+ hours today while on the stationary bike and they didn't feel uncomfortable even after.,508
705,I bought them because reviews on amazon said they were of the same quality of Beats by Dre.,508
706,"Still these are ten bucks, no way these can compete with more expensive headphones.",508
707,The cheap Sony brand works just fine.,508
708,"This is my second purchase, this time as a gift for my wife.",508
709,I bought the Jabra because they can support 2 devices at one time.,508
710,(I must write at least two more words to meet length requirement.),508
711,"I like the easy connectivity, but what they are lacking is different audio settings.",508
712,I bought this for my 14-year-old.,508
713,"When you listen to any song, you can occasionally hear background instruments or percussion very well, this can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the way you view your music.",508
714,This makes the headset unstable and renders the unit useless.,508
715,I must say you can pay $20.00 more and get the bluetooth Nuclear A/V's off Amazon and be blown away by the sound quality.,508
716,"I've been using it for a good 4 month to this date by now, and so far I had absolutely no trouble nor any malfunctions.",508
717,The bass has punch (although still not going to deliver what I'm _really_ looking for) and the highs are clean.,508
718,"Battery life is almost amazing, I haven't really even had to worry about it much.",508
719,I like the state as arrival at their destination.,508
720,These are built to last!,508
721,"Just recently the plug does not stay in all the way in the headphone jack of either my iPad Mini, my Lenovo Tablet, or the TV.",508
722,"I HAVE USED MY KINIVO BTH240,S FOR 3 WEEKS NOW.WOW AM I IMPRESSED.FOR 30 DOLLARS THESE ARE A STEAL.I WORKOUT 4 TIMES A WEEK AND THESE THINGS ARE AMAZING.",508
723,$15 for over the ear headphones is a good price.,508
724,"The leatherette ear cushions also wore out after the first year and a half, but these headphones went through a little bit of a beating in their 2 year lifespan.",508
725,So a nice design.,509
726,At first was comfortable and snug on my head.,509
727,Do yourselves a favor and a little extra money on better headphones!,509
728,"Within 6 months, they started breaking.",509
729,I was so pleased that I purchased three (two black and one white).,509
730,"I love balanced clean sound, but I'm also a child of the 80's... so I like bass I can feel.",509
731,"If you are a hi-fi head, you'll be disappointed with some of the range issues, but for the rest of us mere mortals, they are fantastic and give a true and clear sound.",509
732,You def can hear a wide range of sounds.,509
733,They felt very expensive on my ears!,509
734,I wasn't expecting a whole lot for $25 so I am pleasantly surprised.,509
735,"If value and quantity are important considerations, you won't go wrong here.",509
736,"(Anyway, these puppies look nerdy enough on your ears; if anyone saw you speaking into the ether with them on they'd wonder where your aluminum foil cap was.)",509
737,I am also very happy with Kinivo's customer service.,509
738,Bought these for my kids in school and I didn't want to spend a lot for school supplies.,509
739,If you are looking for legit stereo sound without paying an outrageous amount these are for you.,509
740,so if you are looking for good audio that won't dent your wallet you can always count on these sony headphone to deliver.,509
741,They are not the best head phones in the world but the fact that they are Sony and cost an affordable price makes them great to use.,509
742,Something I cannot do with a couple of other headphones I own that have oval shaped cushions (i.e.,509
743,This is definitely worth your money,509
744,"You can bring these up to passable by boosting the treble, but if you're using a device that has no EQ control beyond bass boost they're going to sound very muffled

The insulating pads.",509
745,"Let me tell you, these things can take a beating.",509
746,and I had it for a year now its been up with my nieces pulling and them sitting on top of them and I will say its put up with all that abuse lol.,509
747,"While I viewed them as a holdover until I could afford something higher-end like the Jaybirds Bluebuds X, I may end up putting off that decision longer than I anticipated!",509
748,Bluetooth range not great but not a detractor.,509
749,"The louder you set the volume, the shorter the battery life.",509
750,"I got two pairs, one for a friend in black and the white ones for me, he said that he really likes them because they sound very clear and have good bass.",510
751,And my workouts are pretty long so I'm impressed.,510
752,"I would expect three weeks out of a pair of ear buds I got from the dollar store, but not from a well-reviewed, kinda pricey set of headphones!",510
753,I have to reconnect it at least 10 times a day.,510
754,"They fit securely but comfortably around the ears, and I haven't experienced any issue with them wanting to come off during workouts.",510
755,I love these headphones.,510
756,"As far as the Kinivo BTH240s, I read the reviews and the 'tweaks' that were made to improve it made it seem like the perfect match for what I was looking for.",510
757,They're the best ones I've ever owned.,510
758,"But these are all small issues in my opinion, definitely not showstoppers.",510
759,"I was better off listening to my iPad with the volume turned up, then using these headsets.",510
760,"After a few hours of use, the drivers sound quality much improved]

I am using them with a Samsung Galaxy S4 and had no trouble connecting them, my first Bluetooth experience.",510
761,Definitely a bargain.,510
762,These are good if you are looking for cheap headphones.,510
763,But it's a good deal for what I'm using it for.,510
764,"I bought these for somebody else and they didn't like them, but I started using them and I use them all of the time now.",510
765,I can keep alert of what happening around me.,510
766,"Well, when compared against my old Sony noise canceling ones, these are pathetic.",510
767,Always go Sony.,510
768,I have not had this frustrating experience with any other bluetooth headphones on the same devices.,510
769,The Kinivo BTH240 is my 3rd pair of bluetooth stereo headphones.,510
770,MUSIC / CALL AUDIO QUALITY : The sound quality is very much acceptable considering the price you pay for this.,510
771,I don't think they are.,510
772,"They're definitely not the greatest headphones, but the sound quality IS good for the price.",510
773,"They Look great, feel great, and sound even better.",510
774,I thought they were going to be one of those crappy headphones that broke after you took it out of the box,510
775,The fit isn't quite as snug as I'd like and the headphones tend to move around slightly while jogging.,511
776,Not to mention they look pretty snazzy.,511
777,Highly recommended.,511
778,Not tight fitting at all and would fall of if you have to bend down quickly to pick something up.,511
779,"However, I don't like exercising with it.",511
780,So far so good with these.,511
781,after first workout they of course got sweaty and to my shock the cushion for ear came off.,511
782,We're totally satisfied with product .,511
783,These are more comfortable and have better sound quality.,511
784,I was looking for decent over-the-ear headphones and found these on Amazon.,511
785,another thing i am a hardcore music lisitner  usually me ears start to buzz when im throu the first 4 hors but with these i could last 8 hors then i had to take them off for 30 min,511
786,"Overall: decent headphones, obviously they're $15 so they're not great, but they do good enough.",511
787,Very disappointed!!,511
788,"The only thing i didn't like , is how it was packaged.",511
789,"Would certainly buy from them again, hopefully these hold up to the daily use while hubby works out",511
790,If anything ever happens to them we will definitely be repurchasing!,511
791,They are pretty tight on the ears.,511
792,the sound quality seems good and the headphones have held up well to use.,511
793,"Up until last night, I was really kind of bragging about how great the second set had been.",511
794,Then finally the exterior bridge that holds the phones on the bar broke.,511
795,Took a few tries before I could turn off the item well.,511
796,2) The headphones don't fit very snug.,511
797,The privacy of knowing that my TV viewing is not disturbing anyone.,511
798,"The Sony ZX100 Over-the-Ear headphone with 30mm driver has about 24 ohms of resistance, requiring 50% more power to operate, but produces a more crisper sound response.",511
799,It's really good on its cheap price.,511
800,You get the value of your money.,512
801,"I like this style of headphones for running as opposed to earphones, because the earphones fall out when I start running at higher speeds.",512
802,"Overall, I can't complain whatsoever about the sound quality.",512
803,These things have fabulous sound and range.,512
804,These look and feel great.,512
805,Only wish they worked properly and that they felt comfy on my ears.,512
806,I used at least 4 days a week.,512
807,"The Sony Stereo Headphones that I purchased from Amazon are just what I wanted to use with my I-Phone 5, from which I access music from my Amazon cloud.",512
808,"Edit: Long time later: Feb 2016  These headphones are still great., They don't make my ears sore anymore.",512
809,"Overall: decent headphones, obviously they're $15 so they're not great, but they do good enough.",512
810,So if you're looking for bass you can literally feel (like many headphones provide) these are not for you.,512
811,"This worked fine, but I did replace it with an $80 Logitech.",512
812,"But, they just mean you can hear the cord moving when the headphones are on, and it's not even a problem.",512
813,This is whayy better than the bluetooth devices that you simply plug into your ear.,512
814,Highly recommended.,512
815,"So basically the warm, good looking, great sounding headphones!",512
816,Great for the price.,512
817,"These headphones are all you need, unless you have a uncontrollable urge for paying too much and have to show thee world you can afford paying for a very fancy shipping box.",512
818,I work in a lab and have to move around a lot while working so getting rid of cables was my highest priority followed closely by battery life.,512
819,I really wanted to get away from the wired ear buds I was using in the office as I would rip them out anytime I turned around.,512
820,"I wouldn't recommend them for hardcore music or gaming, but they're not really designed for that anyway.",512
821,I used it all of 3 times and then they broke.,512
822,"The cords are thicker than my old headphones, but other than that, i love it!",512
823,"I had high hopes, but this just didn't get me there.",512
824,"They work great, are light, and pair quickly with my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 tablets.",512
825,"However, the earphone material broke away and it felt uncomfortable to use.",513
826,The only reason I did not give five stars - they are a little bulky (thick).,513
827,Phone calls sounded great on them and were very clear.,513
828,"Where the Sony's fit the average human head perfectly and securely, the Kinivo's dig into your skull and start hurting after wearing them any longer than a few minutes.",513
829,"I was looking for some wireless headphones but wasn't sure about the sound quality they could have, this headphones are great!",513
830,"I had been searching for days upon days for a headphone, but being the penny pincher that I am I finally found these headphones.",513
831,The connectivity was annoyingly frustrating when I took them to the gym.,513
832,Nice little headphones.,513
833,"I tried other brands and they were okay, but ultimately proved to either be a bit uncomfortable (too rigid) or the speakers would get damaged with the least amount of moisture (sweat).",513
834,I work in a lab and have to move around a lot while working so getting rid of cables was my highest priority followed closely by battery life.,513
835,Gone are the days you can buy a well made pair of headphones or ear-buds for a decent price that will last.,513
836,It use this as my main set but they are good value.,513
837,"When making calls, I can hear others and they can hear me, even with the windows down in the car.",513
838,I think that for the average person who listens to pop or rock will  get the right kick out of these.,513
839,"The wife liked them so much for the gym, she had me order her a second set to wear at work.",513
840,I love it when a small change makes for a large improvement in user enjoyment.,513
841,I discovered that the sound quality was noticeably poor if bearable.,513
842,"These are good, inexpensive general purpose headphones.",513
843,"Its now impossible to charge the headset

COMFORT: The ears are nicely padded,but the clips are close fitting and tend to pinch.",513
844,"This is more the style of the earphone class, and not particular to this model.",513
845,It's easy to switch to accept or make a phone call.,513
846,Provides descent quality sound and are durable.,513
847,The sound is good but the headband is so tight it gives my kids headaches.,513
848,Like so many other reviews at $30 there is little room to nitpick; even if I get better headphones this will surely remain as a sportswear set.,513
849,These are great by any standard.,513
850,They fit really nice.,514
851,These phones are just great!,514
852,Unit arrived early in perfect packing shipment.,514
853,"Only lasted a few months of infrequent, gentle use.",514
854,still working a month later anyway.,514
855,For a low end headphone the plastic is very sturdy and solid.,514
856,"The padding for the ears is way too small, and this would seem comfortable to a small child.",514
857,"I keep them in the outside pocket of my gym bag and they have not broken, I am a little careful with them because they are slight, but that is better than some bulky heavy monster headphones.",514
858,They are exactly like the picture looks.,514
859,"I bought them for my son to use in school, but everyone (including my son) wants to use them at home.",514
860,"If a phone call comes in, it auto-switches to answer it.",514
861,These headphones were a waste of money!!!!,514
862,I've looked up how to fix this online and tried other earbuds/headphones and they worked just fine on my computer.,514
863,They are very easy to pair with an iPad so that I can listen to iTunes or Spotify through my iPad without disturbing my wife.,514
864,Overall it's a good product.,514
865,I was so pleased that I purchased three (two black and one white).,514
866,Got these for my son for school and they work great.,514
867,"I'm a musician so I'm always looking for great studio heaphones or personal monitors, these headphones are worth every penny!",514
868,"You can control volume, track, and answer and make phone calls.",514
869,These headphones are actually a lot better than I was expecting.,514
870,Read one review that made me think twice about this product where a customer said not for people with large head size however I am not the smallest guy and these phones fit me just fine.,514
871,I really like these!,514
872,"After about 7 years of heavy use, the plastic/vinyl on the ear cups is starting to peel away.",514
873,I'm a big guy with a big head and neck BUT I had hoped the designers had factored that into their design specs.,514
874,I was really surprised at the sound quality and also how comfortable this headphone is.,514
875,"These are really affordable headphones, nice and loud with decent bass.",515
876,Quality Headphones for the money.,515
877,Bought some Sony wireless headphones for Christmas this year.,515
878,You can wear them for a long time without getting a headache (also note that I have a big head and a lot of hair so this tends to be a problem for me).,515
879,Only thing that is on the bad side (and it may be a similar problem with other headphones) is how to keep the cord tied down to the headphones when not in use.,515
880,I broke the first pair in one ear because I pulled the cord hard so I got another pair and they are holding up well.,515
881,They have rich deep bass and incredibly clear treble!,515
882,"In their backpacks to listen to music on the bus, at school for various classes, out of the backpack when they were home and countless times of falling asleep with them on, and rolling over onto them in their sleep.",515
883,The sound is muffled and sometimes distorts the low end if you're listening to a song with a lot of it.,515
884,I purchased these headphones because my dad wanted a pair of headphones when he went to work out and go about his daily routine.,515
885,"If you want better quality headphones, I would suggest investing into something better.",515
886,"I HAVE USED MY KINIVO BTH240,S FOR 3 WEEKS NOW.WOW AM I IMPRESSED.FOR 30 DOLLARS THESE ARE A STEAL.I WORKOUT 4 TIMES A WEEK AND THESE THINGS ARE AMAZING.",515
887,I also like how the ear piece swivels to make a much more comfortable fit.,515
888,"Great battery life, strong Bluetooth reception with my phone.",515
889,I either take them off or shift them so that they're hanging on the top part of my ear instead of the part of my ear connected to my head.,515
890,I bought the headphone set for my granddaughter and she was ecstatic!,515
891,"For example, if I put my phone in my front left pocket and walk then the connection has a tendency to break up in time to my steps.",515
892,Headset was portable and folded and it included a micro-usb cable and a microfiber carrying pouch.,515
893,Only done side a little more bass would have been nice.,515
894,They feel as equally comfortable around your neck as in your head.,515
895,It's not uncomfortable but it does feel like they're going to get pushed off your ears if you're laying back against something.,515
896,"These headphones are alright for the task, but two issues are annoying me such that I'll soon be replacing them.",515
897,The only feature they have is earpieces that cover the full ear canal opening to muffle external sound waves.,515
898,"The microphone does not register anything at all until you are speaking at COMICALLY LOUD VOLUMES, and my guildies on ventrilo tell me the mic sounds like I'm yelling into an old time radio inside a tin can underwater.",515
899,"There is a soft feel to these headphones that integrate with the body, on the head and too in perception of sound that just feels natural, ergonomic in the highest sense of that term, again in relation to the price.",515
900,"Really good sound quality, and a fairly comfortable fit.",516
901,"They're low priced, but get the job done.",516
902,Fortunately I still had my old ear buds so was able to make it through the movie.,516
903,I wear a 7.5 hat and these don't fit me well.,516
904,The only thing it's missing is bass but other than that the sound is clear.,516
905,Plugin is a little tight when charging.,516
906,This Sony product is the best stereo headphone I have purchased to date and it exceeded my expectations.,516
907,They produce crisp high's and nice bass with balanced midrange.,516
908,"I've purchased some other headphones in this price range that have served me well, but I don't think these would make it a week.",516
909,They were and they sent me a pair as well.,516
910,"I love the red thing that help you know where is the Right side of the Headphone, Very good sound for the price, few bass but is ok you are not paying much.",516
911,"This is less than that, do not buy these.",516
912,"One star less because it is not in same league as those top of the line headsets but as I said, super value for money.",516
913,"Unless they fix the firmware issues with these headphones, I would pass on these.",516
914,I bought my daughter a pair for Christmas because I liked the color.,516
915,I bought these for workouts but sadly they are way too bulky.,516
916,"I read where it is hard to tell which side is L or R, I've found that the R has a small red band making it easy to define it as R.

I read where it needed a battery, there is no battery required.",516
917,Honestly I rather have these than spend 200$ on a pair of beats when sound quality is superior for the price.,516
918,"I was looking for some wireless headphones but wasn't sure about the sound quality they could have, this headphones are great!",516
919,They will amaze you!,516
920,"One minor irritation is that the back of the headphone, that is, the plastic link between the earpieces, gets in the way, if I am leaning on my sofa or lying down,  If that part could be made thinner and adjustable, it would be a five star product",516
921,I don't take these outside and I barely use it indoors.,516
922,Probably the best investment I could have made in graduate school.,516
923,The price was nice ($25) they arrived the next day and I started using them immediately.,516
924,Exactly what I expected from a low priced Sony headset.,516
925,I had two of these... one stopped working after two months and the other still works but the mic doesn't work.,517
926,"I also have a petite frame and, I assume, smaller head and I have lots of room in these in the back so I imagine they'd for someone with a larger head as well.",517
927,The quality when using it for phone calls is very poor.,517
928,"Cons - Ears get a little hot with prolonged use, so I adjust them occasionnaly for a little more airflow.",517
929,The sound is spectacular!,517
930,These headphones are just whatever.,517
931,"And finally, a curious statement printed on the back of the package: ""If you use the headphones with WALKMAN that has a noise canceling function, the noise canceling function will not work.""",517
932,This is certainly the case here as well.,517
933,"On the downside, I have a wide face and normal human ears and it's a tight, somewhat uncomfortable fit.",517
934,"I got a call while running the other day and I had no trouble picking it up, I heard them clearly and they could hear me as well.",517
935,I would definitely recommend these to those who don't want to spend too much but still get good sound in return.,517
936,"It isn't much weight, though.",517
937,"On the other hand, they sound great and are at a fantastic price point.",517
938,"The headphones themselves are hard to keep attached to the ears, at least mine, falling off frequently with light movement.",517
939,My kiddo is tough on head phones.,517
940,I needed a cheap pair of head phones that I was hoping would give decent sound.,517
941,"I did that, but the sound quality was still bad.",517
942,These seem like a great buy and well made.,517
943,"Same problem each time, one side stops working.",517
944,Great deal for headphones.,517
945,"Plastic head strap seems sturdy enough, but it's day one.",517
946,"I have not done a phone call with this, so I cannot attest to how well you'd sound on the other end and vice versa.",517
947,The earpads rotate so it is more compact.,517
948,"This is my second purchase, this time as a gift for my wife.",517
949,"They are comfortable, and drown out sound pretty well.",517
950,Tried it for a short bit around the house.,518
951,The battery lasts with average usage 10 or so hours.,518
952,"Amazing sound and good bass, but the headphones did not look good when you had them on.",518
953,I'm amazed at the stereo separation achieved with a wireless signal.,518
954,"""They work"" is about all I can say about these headphones.",518
955,These are just what I wanted.,518
956,No matter what brand.,518
957,Outstanding product.,518
958,"As a musician, gamer, student, and office worker, I have a few different kinds of headphones.",518
959,"The company is not aiming to produce a pair of stellar-quality headphones at under $20, just a pair that will suffice for the average user.",518
960,"These are great, inexpensive headphones for watching Netflix from your laptop or tablet.",518
961,"When I ordered this product I thought it was just going to be another pair of headphones, boy was I wrong.",518
962,However if u want to go jogging or bike riding then u may have some connections issues and that is the case for most if not all bluetooth wireless headsets.,518
963,"There is no tone definition, very muddy sounding.",518
964,Buying another set for a friend.,518
965,I've had them for about 8 workouts now and they've been great!,518
966,Its easy to conceal since it sits comfortably over the ears and behind the neck and under my hair.,518
967,"I didn't hear the noise while doing the eliptical machine at the club, only when running outside.",518
968,"SO because of that, I am reordering another of the same pair now in April 2016.",518
969,I BOUGHT A 2ND SET FOR MY WIFE TO PRACTICE HER GUITAR THRU A SMALL AMP AND SHE LOVES THEM AS WELL.,518
970,"They definitely get the job done and for the price, there really isn't any complaint I could make.",518
971,"If you have it hooked up to a phone, and are listening to music, the music stops so you can listen to the call.",518
972,"Really Sony, 3 ft?",518
973,"Having said all that, I blame myself, not the headphones.",518
974,SONY did a good job as a big brand should,518
975,"The sound quality is good (not perfect, but still), and they don't break easily.",519
976,I purchased these because I have gotten up from my desk far too many times - completely forgetting I was attached to computer by a headset jack - these certainly solve that problem!,519
977,I use these all the time at work and I think I charge it once or twice a month.,519
978,I like that they don't pinch and still stays on when I run or mountain bike.,519
979,"It remains to be seen how the collapsible neck piece stands up, but initial build quality seems good.",519
980,The distance you can go is pretty good.,519
981,"Purchased in late May 2015 and just discovered it died, will not charge - I got about 18 months of use out of it, but really expected more for the price (around $25 at time of purchase).",519
982,I use them daily.,519
983,Gift for my wife as she had been using some pretty crude earphones to listen to music from her laptop.,519
984,The only negative is the material around the headphones has started to peel off.,519
985,Without disputing the sound quality they are definitely not over the ear and the Amazon site provides an inadequate description.,519
986,Decent sound for the price.,519
987,Maybe it's because I have a big head.,519
988,"Sony has had their ups and downs over the years (eh hem, PS4...), but at least they are unwilling to license their name to a total piece of junk.",519
989,If you have to go into another room to not hear outside noises--what's the point of using the headphones?,519
990,"Up to now it works fine, no music ""skipped"" at all.",519
991,"All in all, they are priced cheap, but you get a ton of bang for your buck in terms of quality.",519
992,Bought these for quiet netflix watching and song listening on my chrome book and these definitely do the trick.,519
993,I would like to know if any recalls are available for this item!,519
994,"Given the price, this should be expected.",519
995,"They can be better, but the price will also be higher.",519
996,For this price you can't ask for anything better.,519
997,In the sound department they're both great and I have no issue with that.,519
998,I Olympic weightlift and these do not slip during any movement.,519
999,So far (after 4 workouts) they have not let me down.,519
1000,The controls are very intuitive.,520
1001,so why would i rate this thing 5 stars?,520
1002,"Overall, they were a great value, no complaints about the sound.",520
1003,I just wanted to write a quick review because of the sound quality.,520
1004,I've bought Sony earbuds for about $10 that sound alot better and dynamic than these headphones.,520
1005,"I do turn them off when I'm not using them, instead of leaving them in stand-by, so that might have something to do with it.",520
1006,They are fantastic!,520
1007,Range on the bluetooth is pretty generous before the audio drops.,520
1008,So far I really like them.,520
1009,"Had them for 3 weeks now, using them a couple of hours a day, 5 days a week and I just now had to charge them since my first charge.",520
1010,The ONLY draw back to these headphones is that if you wear glasses (like I do) it takes some adjusting so that the ear handles of your glasses don't keep the headphones from sitting right...,520
1011,I can't believe the quality of it.,520
1012,"They can be better, but the price will also be higher.",520
1013,"For the sound quality, you get more than what you paid for.",520
1014,"are very comfortable, I like the color green, but on the picture they see green with white, and when they arrived they were green with beige, but equally the use that is given is good, we like a good buy",520
1015,Very decent headphones for the price!,520
1016,Sounds good for the modest price.,520
1017,"My complaints are mostly about how they are built:  The cord is extremely short, even shorter than the MDR-V150, and it's taking some getting used to.",520
1018,"For the price, the Kinivo BTH240 is very good, comparable to headsets that cost hundreds of dollars.",520
1019,I have been useing ear buds for so long I forgot how nice a set of headphones can be.,520
1020,"The ends both turn flat, which is great for packing them in my bag with my books.",520
1021,Great price too.,520
1022,The sound is good for the price and the wire is not flimsy.,520
1023,The headphones are also secure enough to not fall off when you're doing bench press.,520
1024,"It would be nice if they folded into a travel pouch, but with all their other virtues plus the low price I'm not complaining.",520
1025,I discovered that the sound quality was noticeably poor if bearable.,521
1026,i recommend these.,521
1027,"My only quibbles are the fit (they keep sliding off of my ears -- I have small ears and long hair that tucks behind my ears and I often wear the headphones and sunglasses at the same time, and the headphones won't stay on.",521
1028,Would purchase again without hesitation!,521
1029,features - the 3.5mm jack is molded with a 90 angle.,521
1030,Just no comparison in my opinion.,521
1031,This is my second pair the first worked great and I loved it.,521
1032,"My first set my daughter broke, my second set my kitten chewed.",521
1033,The only reason I didn't give it four stars was the occasional cracking noise that I would hear when moving to a distant area from the Bluetooth device but that seems common in any Bluetooth device.,521
1034,My previous pair lasted over two years while being used daily by my two boys ages 16 and 10.,521
1035,Good quality stereo headphones and very attractively priced!,521
1036,Decent bass response.,521
1037,"This may not sound like much to some, but in the world of audio and video, a one second delay makes content nearly unwatchable.",521
1038,They just apologize and send another.,521
1039,I plan on buying another pair soon.,521
1040,"as expensive but they are so fine, that you should just buy two.",521
1041,"They are very comfortable and also look nice in the white, I use these more than my iPhone 5 earbuds now.",521
1042,Love that they fold flat and can be stored in a briefcase of backpack.,521
1043,These headphones have great clarity listening to music with ample bass.,521
1044,I've purchased three pairs of these for my kids (two pairs in white/pink and one in blue/black).,521
1045,"The frame is light, sturdy, and well-designed for everyday use.",521
1046,Long term durability is questionable at best.,521
1047,"FYI, these are awesome but they do not fold unless I am missing something!",521
1048,Sound Quality (4 stars): Sound quality is enjoyable.,521
1049,"And it works perfectly with my android tablet, PC, and phone.",521
1050,"I traveled with these, stuffing them in the most obscure places.",522
1051,"6) can pair them to my phone, and my laptop.",522
1052,Best headphone I've ever used.,522
1053,They sound ok - especially after the in ear wired set I was using started to drive me crazy.,522
1054,"The handiness of bluetooth combine with how small and lightweight the item is to create the perfect ""jogger's headphones"".",522
1055,For the price and quality I'd buy them again.,522
1056,No complaints at all.,522
1057,"The last pair lasted two weeks, but that was partly due to his best friend.",522
1058,Exactly as pictured.,522
1059,"I have an older version of these headphones at home that still work well, but wanted another set for work.",522
1060,They are also very easily adjusted and can be changed around to fit your individual measurement.,522
1061,Then if you lost it you would have to buy another otherwise you couldn't charge the headphones?,522
1062,I recommend buying these.,522
1063,The only thing I didn't like was that after a bit the top of my head where the band goes across gets warm ... but that also happens if I so much as wear a hat.,522
1064,"That being said, I purchased these for my 14yr old son for Xmas for his mp3.",522
1065,"Nope, they're pretty comfortable, and I've rarely found headphone I didn't hate, I have a rather large head and imagine they'd be super comfortable on most people.",522
1066,Bought this product after seeing high reviews !!,522
1067,"They feel light weight and easily breakable so we've been treating these delicately, but they work great and totally tune out background noise.",522
1068,Some final tidbits for those who care about these things.,522
1069,As a telephone - sound quality when receiving and sending - I was not as impressed.,522
1070,"After almost 3 and a half years they still do their job perfectly, just some missing chrome from the track/volume buttons and the outer skin of the pads peeling off.",522
1071,"This set can be stored away flattened, you simply turn the phones in sideways.",522
1072,This makes the headset unstable and renders the unit useless.,522
1073,They are not as comfortable on my head as the old Motorola they are replacing after 6 years but they also cost less than 1/2 of the old unit.,522
1074,It came on time as well.,522
1075,"Cons:
 - Although they were comfortable, they hurt my ears after prolonged wear.",523
1076,I'm surprised at how clear and easy they are to use.,523
1077,"I might have gotten a defective one - my last pair lasted MUCH longer - but even so, very disappointed.",523
1078,Can't believe these were so highly rated.,523
1079,Use them to work out at the gym.,523
1080,"I Google headphones, asked friends for their opinions, YouTubed  videos and ultimately decided to give these a shot.",523
1081,But I'll need to take anger management classes if I keep them myself.,523
1082,I have used them all week at the gym and they are the best!,523
1083,they would be fine.,523
1084,I had to call Apple and they were able to help me pair it.,523
1085,She has multiple sclerosis and has no feeling in her arms and hands.,523
1086,For the money...they work well.,523
1087,I would recommend byting this with such price.,523
1088,We already had red ones so we knew they were great headphones.,523
1089,"- Very affordable

Cons:
  - No battery indicator, but it starts beeping in your ear when it's getting low.",523
1090,Bono's voice sounds greater than ever!,523
1091,For headphones made by Sony this is a great deal.,523
1092,The cushioning around the ear is also very comfortable as well.,523
1093,I have to buy a second one becuase i broke the wire to the left speaker,523
1094,"As I mentioned, these are not the headphones that you want if you are an audiophile seeking perfect sound, heavy bass response or noise cancelling capabilities.",523
1095,I need head phones to listen to my ipod.,523
1096,"The speaker began to crackle in my left ear (it sounded as if it was max volume out of that ear, while the right ear was working normally at the set volume).",523
1097,I purchased the white one for my mother and it looks classy!,523
1098,"You'll be fine listening to rap and hip-hop, but stuff like dubstep, with alot of bass, would sound bad.",523
1099,I haven't charge it yet and I have been using it for 8 hours from out of the box.,523
1100,"The sound is pretty good and when I use it to make calls, I've had no complaints about the microphone quality.",524
1101,"I chose Sony because the extension connecting the headphones to any device is flexible, thus allowing the headphones to last longer despite.",524
1102,I can tell I have a headset on when talking to others but they all say they cant tell one bit that I was on my headset!,524
1103,"If you sit or lay in absolute darkness, they can light up half the room lol.",524
1104,"Its now impossible to charge the headset

COMFORT: The ears are nicely padded,but the clips are close fitting and tend to pinch.",524
1105,I'm not sure if I'm crazy or not but it makes sense as the right ear is the one with all the controls.,524
1106,"The sound on these are better than Apple headphones, I can assure you of that.",524
1107,The price was nice ($25) they arrived the next day and I started using them immediately.,524
1108,"I mainly purchased these headphones for their nice white and black look which matches my HTC phone, their call quality and being able to control music from the heaphones is fantastic.",524
1109,"For the price, the Kinivo BTH240 is very good, comparable to headsets that cost hundreds of dollars.",524
1110,They're loud enough and the bass is deep enough and they have accompanied me through some strenuous and sweaty activities.,524
1111,"What I would suggest the manufacturer for a future version is slightly better looks and amazing noice cancellation, I'd pay 60 dollars also!",524
1112,No issues here.,524
1113,"if you listen to music all the time, it may disappoint you.",524
1114,"I purchased these headphones for my son in hopes that I would no longer be subjected to hours and hours of minecraft coming from my sons tablet....well, they worked for about 2 weeks before no sound came from the right speaker anymore.",524
1115,They are great for using at home when you just want to relax and listen to your favorite jams.,524
1116,They are the Best I've found for the price.,524
1117,Sony's website lists them as not circumaural[0].,524
1118,I was also able to tolerate the behind-the-neck - it only bothers me when I try to stretch my head and neck back which I can live with (although I think I will try top-of-the-head phones next).,524
1119,5 stars because of the combination of product and customer service.,524
1120,I was searching high and low for bluetooth wireless headphones to use with my iPhone and iPod.,524
1121,These headphones are superb for the price.,524
1122,"The price is so good, that I had trouble justifying paying the same amount for a protective case for them, so they won't get banged up in my backpack.",524
1123,I like the compact size as well.,524
1124,"They certainly do not compare to Bose in sound quality or comfort, but for the price, the sound quality is quite good and they appear to be reasonably durable.",524
1125,I plan on taking better care of these.,525
1126,Even used it for Skype/Ventrilo/Mumble/etc voice services on the computer.,525
1127,I read some of the reviews about these headphones before buying them.,525
1128,The biggest pro so far is that they are quite comfortable.,525
1129,"As for the cups themselves, they have a nice cushion.",525
1130,I've bought Sony earbuds for about $10 that sound alot better and dynamic than these headphones.,525
1131,In regards to sound it does fine.,525
1132,"We went through countless ear buds and headsets, most would last a week if we were lucky.",525
1133,I BOUGHT A 2ND SET FOR MY WIFE TO PRACTICE HER GUITAR THRU A SMALL AMP AND SHE LOVES THEM AS WELL.,525
1134,The sound is good for the price and the wire is not flimsy.,525
1135,"The ONLY complaint I have, which is not enough to knock off a star, is the aesthetics of these.",525
1136,I liked the price so I took a chance.,525
1137,I have had them for over a week and have not had to recharge them yet.for the price they are the best investment with superior sound quality.,525
1138,I was a little worried they would fall off.,525
1139,Cannot get the headphones to pair with any bluetooth items.,525
1140,Great sound and hopefully durable for the long haul!,525
1141,"Regardless, they have been the longest lasting headphones I've ever owned.",525
1142,"Fit snugly, are rugged, pairs easily and can handle phone calls decently (though I have had issues recently where it dropped connection due to low battery).",525
1143,The sound is amazing and clear and they are extremely comfortable even after wearing them for hours.,525
1144,"This was purchased to go with a pocket voice recorder, and has decent frequency response for voice recordings.",525
1145,This product delivers and so much more.,525
1146,"They're not high end headphones by any means, but they sound great for the price and they don't seem to randomly stop working after 8 months like other low price headphones do.",525
1147,I've had my pair for almost 4 years.,525
1148,"I bought them for my 13 year old son, so his stupid games on his stupid tablet don't annoy me (smiley face).",525

1152,"Not deep, but decent.",526
1153,Headphones will not pair with my computer.,526
1154,"When you listen to any song, you can occasionally hear background instruments or percussion very well, this can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the way you view your music.",526
1155,I ordered these to use strictly at my computer because I wanted the household noise to be blocked out.,526
1156,I received the item within two days of placing the order so I was extremely happy about that.,526
1157,"It seems best for walkers, joggers, cyclists.",526
1158,"The plastic is just porous enough to take to sharpies, paint markers, and stickers, so you can customize them to your heart's content.",526
1159,i put these headphones through a lot of crap.,526
1160,They have good clear sound reproduction as well they adjust all the way down to fit a smaller child's head with no problem.,526

1162,Excellent for these purposes.,526
1163,She says they work great and she loves the quality of the sound.,526
1164,"This headset is no disappointment very comfortable to ware (I have big head and I will usually feel pressure on my head after 4 hours of wearing it, pretty good compare to 2 hours or less when I wear my other expensive pare)

Highly recommend.",526
1165,They are not very comfortable.,526
1166,"Works well as cell phone bluetooth, but does NOT work with LG TV as I was hoping!",526
1167,"Sound is very good for an on-ear model, and you can wear them for quite awhile without discomfort.",526
1168,"My Bose headphones died after ten years of hard use, so I bought these thinking they would be a good temporary set until I chose a more permanent set.",526

1176,"For this price, that's fine.",527
1177,I wanted wireless to minimize the clutter on my body when I go out for the ride.,527
1178,They are very durable and have a nice sound quality.,527
1179,you are still looking for more pros?,527
1180,It was worth it to pay a little extra.,527
1181,It's more of a mechanical settle bass.,527
1182,"A note about the cord, It's short.",527
1183,"With these, I get the full surround on my ears, no headaches from the plastic connection, the cord a good length, and the sound is excellent.",527
1184,"For the price (less than 15 bucks), the headphones are working well.",527
1185,Then I joined a gym with the MUSIC LOOP FROM HELL.,527
1186,"I get a crazy long range, maybe about 100-150 feet from one end of the plant to the trailer bay.",527
1187,"They looked all right during the purchase, but after receiving it and actually wearing it to and from the gym, I have to honestly say they're not the coolest of things.",527
1188,I listen to music most of the time at work and I can't constantly fiddle with these and get things done.,527
1189,All in all I couldn't be happier and for the price it's a no brainer.,527
1190,Low price available at Amazon.com only.,527
1191,I have finally found a set of wireless headphones that stay on my ears without being too bulky.,527
1192,I love how these headphones make it so easy for me to listen to music or a show on my tablet while being able to move around freely.,527
1193,Affordable too!,527
1194,Extremely affordable for the average worker who just wants to listen to music at work or at home.,527
1195,They have good sound for just listening to music or movies.,527
1196,1 is the cord is very short.,527
1197,"Sound:
+ Mostly full range, loud, crisp and clear in most of the needed range.",527
1198,"I've read that some sound quality gets lost, but I never noticed, since I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks.",527
1199,Wondering how long before it breaks but I'm guessing it will really last...hahaha.,527
1200,"The sound quality is good (not perfect, but still), and they don't break easily.",528
1201,"I am purchasing another pair today so I can have a dedicated unit for work, I am confident my old pair will continue to perform for the next year so in my locker they go!",528
1202,"Clear sound, no punching bass like the XB series but still good enough to sound good on a rap track.",528
1203,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DESIGNED .,528
1204,They come with a long cord which is convenient for the purpose of their use.,528
1205,I bought these because I like to keep up with fashion and ear buds don't stay in my ears.,528
1206,Mids and highs are very clear and crisp.,528
1207,I will buy more from Kinivo products in the future.,528
1208,I also use them to listen to iHeart Radio from my iPhone.,528
1209,"Regardless, they have been the longest lasting headphones I've ever owned.",528
1210,The head size is decent (I have a big head and it fits over my head comfortably).,528
1211,I love these headphones.,528
1212,The phone is ok. Not the best mic but for the money they are worth it.,528
1213,I can use them for an hour or so without getting tired of them.,528
1214,Then if you lost it you would have to buy another otherwise you couldn't charge the headphones?,528
1215,"Removing the consideration of price, I give these 3 stars.",528
1216,"Some of the button functions, such as play/pause, are not instantaneous.",528
1217,Charging times are quick and charging is painless.,528
1218,I am a truck driver that drives a 90's Ford truck with lots of noise.,528
1219,Arrived earlier than expected.,528
1220,"The sound quality is not breathtaking my any means, but I believe a very good value for the price.",528
1221,This is my third pair and I absolutely love them.,528
1222,They are great for the price if you just want to have a way to monitor things without bothering others.,528
1223,So if you're looking for bass you can literally feel (like many headphones provide) these are not for you.,528
1224,"He is 11 and they fit him well, and now we do not have to listen to his YouTube videos about Minecraft, etc.",528
1225,If you are looking for audiophile quality why are you buying $20 headphones??????????,529
1226,I listen to mostly podcasts.,529
1227,We are happy about the purchase.,529
1228,"Of course, this wasn't strictly managed by my phone.",529
1229,Easily heard by people around you.,529
1230,I'm a big guy with a big head and neck BUT I had hoped the designers had factored that into their design specs.,529
1231,I'm really happy that I went with these headphones.,529
1232,And they are good for that.,529
1233,The ear padding gets really wet for me and feels slippery which creates an uncomfortable feeling.,529
1234,Mediocre product and performance.,529
1235,It isn't that bad unless you want the music blasting your ears off in which these won't do.,529
1236,"I do not like though, that it is not compatible with my flip phone (my backup) but it is compatible with my Iphone (my everyday phone), so I'm ok with that.",529
1237,Probably the 300 offers a better bass quality.,529
1238,Bought these for quiet netflix watching and song listening on my chrome book and these definitely do the trick.,529
1239,"can't even return them they, as they are already out of the return policy.",529
1240,I'll update this review in a few months when they're good and burned in and I get them away from him for a bit to listen again.,529
1241,If it turns out that it is just my phone and it works great on other stuff then yeah I would suggest it.,529
1242,Very pleased thus far with the product and  Blue Rigger service.,529
1243,"For Sony these are good headphones for the price tag, had them for about 6 months they are good sounding they have alright bass but very clean highs.",529
1244,"I can't recommend this item, and I hope they can improve the headphones.",529
1245,However they only look good if they are around your neck.,529
1246,"Oh, and if you have a big head don't even bother.",529
1247,These headphones are bulky and weigh almost twice as much as the S305's.,529
1248,Cops have showed up at my house to verify if everything is okay.,529
1249,But then I started hearing jumbled voices on a few of my calls and I doubled checked - it wasn't the internet connection.,529
1250,I haven't charge it yet and I have been using it for 8 hours from out of the box.,530
1251,Buying another set for a friend.,530
1252,"Regardless, they have been the longest lasting headphones I've ever owned.",530
1253,"One Con:
I am working on finding the comfort factor for wearing them for extended periods as they go over the ears and rest on the back of my neck.",530
1254,The sound comes out clearly and they stay on pretty well as i jog.,530
1255,They bounce just slightly when on a run but will not fall off.,530
1256,The frequency response was terrible.,530
1257,My two boys ( teenagers) use them for school and for their music and there has been no complaint on the sound.,530
1258,These can be bought for prices as low as $14 or $12.,530
1259,Great price too.,530
1260,Excellent for these purposes.,530
1261,I don't know if I should get these or the new ones...,530
1262,"They are very nice , lightweight, which is what I wanted.",530
1263,I cannot stand wearing earbuds because they constantly fall out and they make my ears sore.,530
1264,"Well, four; add on Price.",530
1265,I like the white color and the red detail.,530
1266,"the headphones (on ear)
2.)",530
1267,Very much worth the money.,530
1268,Probably the best investment I could have made in graduate school.,530
1269,"But I highly suggest these headphones because for $11, you cant beat the price for the quality you get they are well worth it.",530
1270,The headphones fit comfortably and they are snug and do not move while running.,530
1271,"All I can say they are better than the more expensive phones I bought elsewhere on line that were called the deal of the day
Update: thin material on the foam earphones flakes off little by little leaving white speckles on your ears.",530
1272,"Once the call ended, the music came right back.",530
1273,The price was right so I figured I would give them a try.,530
1274,Knocked rating down to one star because of this.,530
1275,"AFTER MY FIRST TRY I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM, THE SOUND IS LOUD AND DETAILED, THE BASS IS JUST RIGHT, NOT TOO MUCH TO THE POINT IT DISTORTS THE QUALITY OF SONGS.",531
1276,I like how they came with a travel pouch/ bag.,531
1277,Decent paid of mid-level head phones.,531
1278,They do a great job of blocking out external sound.,531
1279,Just don;t expect too much for $15.,531
1280,They don't really serve the purpose for what I wanted them for.,531
1281,Well done Amazon/Sony.,531
1282,"Three qualities are most important to me in any set of headphones: Durability, Sound Quality, and Comfort.",531
1283,My son wanted these so he got them.,531
1284,"It's been a while since I bought some over ear headphones... and let me say that I love headphones, and while I love my music, I wouldn't say that I could qualify as a true audiophile.",531
1285,"Outside sounds, like sounds of shrieking children while you're wearing headphones, seemed to be amplified to a piercing sound to me.",531
1286,I bought the Jabra because they can support 2 devices at one time.,531
1287,"Amazing product regardless, though!",531
1288,I ended up immediately purchasing Bose AE2i's and am extremely happy with them.,531
1289,"Sound is balanced, not too much of anything (so the bass wasn't that good for electronic music and such, but it was there)but a little muffled.",531
1290,I wore these one day and did not know there was a car behind me.,531
1291,I was a bit disappointed I had a pair of the MDRZX100 and wanted another pair since my first messed up.,531
1292,One star only because there's no negative.,531
1293,Even the 'leather' ear padding (didn't know it came like that.,531
1294,I bought the Photive BTH3 instead and wish I hadn't wasted my time these headphones.,531
1295,I bought these in 2013.,531
1296,The price makes this product even better.,531
1297,"Obviously I can hear well enough or I would have replaced them, but still.",531
1298,We bought these for our son and they broke within 90 days.,531
1299,They're just what I was looking for -- though it would be cool if they had a discrete microphone.,531
1300,"Got these a long time ago, still kicking.",532
1301,First off let me say I did not give this 5 stars because of its hi fidelity sound.,532
1302,"Since these cover the ear, I figured I'd give them a shot.",532
1303,I'm still contemplating reordering because I do like them.,532
1304,Over the ear without encasing my whole head and heating me up.,532
1305,"I'm not sure if this is the headphones or the mp3 player I use, but it only works somewhat.",532
1306,NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL and not adjustable.,532
1307,Great price too.,532
1308,Then I joined a gym with the MUSIC LOOP FROM HELL.,532
1309,Light weight and good sound quality (it's no Bose but decent for the price).,532
1310,Personally I feel that they are better.,532
1311,These headphones are superb for the price.,532
1312,If you are looking for audiophile quality why are you buying $20 headphones??????????,532
1313,My previous pair lasted over two years while being used daily by my two boys ages 16 and 10.,532
1314,I bought this color and the white one for my kids that last longer than other brands.,532
1315,I purchased the Artic P311 and Kinivo BTH204 together.,532
1316,"For the price, Yeh they're worth $15 but not much more.",532
1317,Battery life is good for workouts.,532
1318,"I have reviewed your order and am prepared to assist further.""",532
1319,"Also, while it is lightly sitting on ear, it also isolates the noise pretty well.",532
1320,Knocked rating down to one star because of this.,532
1321,Took a couple times of listening to them to break in the sound quality but they are great for the price.,532
1322,I use these pretty regularly and have had them for about a year.,532
1323,For only 15-20$ you absolutely cannot go wrong.,532
1324,You would be disappointed.,532
1325,The pink color is a little flatter and not as bright as you would think.,533
1326,They were and they sent me a pair as well.,533
1327,I have to physically move the sound system's volume meter to be able to reach.,533
1328,This headset is excellent except for the muffled at times when i talk to someone.,533
1329,They cover your ears well and are adjustable.,533
1330,These are also very nice looking & look more expensive than they are.,533
1331,other than that they hold a long charge.,533
1332,"They're small and would be a great size for a child, the sound quality is ok, it sounds a bit low and the bass isn't much, it doesn't sound like the 20$ sony headphones, this pair would be a step down from that.",533
1333,Other than that these have been excellent.,533
1334,What is there NOT to like??,533
1335,The phone is ok. Not the best mic but for the money they are worth it.,533
1336,These have about half the distance before signal cuts out.,533
1337,"I did that, but the sound quality was still bad.",533
1338,Great for wearing for long periods of time!,533
1339,My son goes through headphones like crazy.,533
1340,Headphone is very lightweight and confortable.,533
1341,Why wouldnt you buy these they are perfect for jogging or taking to school to and plug into your laptop.,533
1342,These headphones were recommended to me by a colleague.,533
1343,"That said, the instructions for all of these tasks were abundantly clear.",533
1344,"With these, I get the full surround on my ears, no headaches from the plastic connection, the cord a good length, and the sound is excellent.",533
1345,Sony headphones are pretty good with great sound and fix very well on my head and ears.,533
1346,"They're a little big at the back, so when I lay flat it does get pushed a bit, but not uncomfortably so.",533
1347,All three are in great working condition and my kids do a good job of working them.,533
1348,"I have 4 pair just lying around the house, so that when someone wants to use them, they can.",533
1349,I love it when a small change makes for a large improvement in user enjoyment.,533
1350,I think these things will cause wear over time and cause these sort of issues.,534
1351,"Same problem each time, one side stops working.",534
1352,Use them to work out at the gym.,534
1353,"These are, in my opinion, quite a step up.",534
1354,I am returning them and buying a new pair once more hopefully these will not cut in and out.,534
1355,I use it for running and walking.,534
1356,It was delivered one day ahead of the scheduled date.,534
1357,- Fit my head well (size 7 5/8 hat) and stayed in place while active.,534
1358,"Both models respond well to my phone's EQ app, letting me boost the deep bass and highest treble.",534
1359,"Excellent headset for price, very comfortable.",534
1360,I was worried that the area where the ears would rest would be stiff and not be very comfortable against my ears.,534
1361,It folds up nicely for travel.,534
1362,"When making calls, I can hear others and they can hear me, even with the windows down in the car.",534

1365,I am seriously amazed at how good these sound.,534
1366,"Overall these are the best pair of Stereo Bluetooth headphones I've ever used and I've tried Plantronics, Motorola 305's and Sony.",534
1367,Folds up neatly for travelling.,534
1368,But I'll survive.,534
1369,"Since these are not in ear, when you put the volume pretty loud, other people can hear your music.",534
1370,They are comfortable.,534
1371,"2.  not a huge problem, but the 240's are thinner than the 220's by a good margin.",534
1372,"The LG's were comfy and looked nice, but when it came to walking or jogging they eventually broke.",534
1373,My main purpose for these are for phone conversations which sound crystal clear.,534

1379,The distance says up to 30ft.,535
1380,"While I viewed them as a holdover until I could afford something higher-end like the Jaybirds Bluebuds X, I may end up putting off that decision longer than I anticipated!",535
1381,"The ones I had were actually Sony, and more expensive than these headphones!!!!",535
1382,They are comfortable.,535
1383,I'm just reviewing so the average Joe can know that these headphones are worth the $15 and that it is a great purchace.,535
1384,Highly recommend this product.,535
1385,"I purchased this set of headphones, in addition to the Koss UR-20, for use with my portable mp3 player.",535

1387,I really wanted these to work since I've been trying to find comfortable headphones for running for a while.,535
1388,"I got two pairs, one for a friend in black and the white ones for me, he said that he really likes them because they sound very clear and have good bass.",535
1389,i think they are better then just basic ear budds.,535
1390,Then let's talk about how they make your ears sweat alot!,535
1391,I guess you get what you pay for.,535
1392,These look and feel nice for the price.,535
1393,A real plus is that I can war them at home and not have to have my phone close.,535

1395,"I don't care much about audio quality beyond a certain level of competence, but have gone through dozens of headphone models, and these are decent on that count, certainly better than your typical earbuds.",535
1396,I use it for watching movies on my ipad - not looking for the best quality audio for listening to music.,535
1397,This headphone is the bomb.,535

1407,"For those that never tried a pair of middle to upper grade headphones, these are sure to delight.",536

1409,I was a little worried they would fall off.,536
1410,If I wanted something high end I would of paid high end money.,536

1420,I can now use my phone charger instead of having to locate my old phone charger and have two chargers.,536
1421,"Im the kind of person that only uses earbuds but i got this because of the low price and how they look....But OMG when they came i was so happy,they work great,they are awesome!",536
1422,Con: Well you're outside with these pads on your ears.,536
1423,Sony and every other manufacturer of headphones apparently thinks the headphones are used on commercial aircraft where the connection to the audio source  is only 30 inches away.,536
1424,Instructions are clearly written and the battery last a long time.,536
1425,I use my Kinivo headphones every day on the way to work and during my clerical day where all I do is data entry.,537
1426,They are also as it stated on arrival-refurbished.,537

1428,There are other Sennheiser options in the sub-20 dollar range that have much better sound than these.,537
1429,"I've had them for several months (to make sure they didn't short-out like some of the reviews have claimed),and I am totally pleased.",537
1430,I've had mine for years and they still work.,537
1431,"But, anyway, I've had no problems with the product.",537
1432,Used them for my workouts until one day (after a owning them only a month) they stopped holding a charge.,537
1433,The only reason they get a 4 is because of the slight rattle of the buttons and time I had to spend getting them to my comfort level.,537
1434,Some final tidbits for those who care about these things.,537
1435,It has a good level of keeping outside noises out but not to the extent where you can't hear anything.,537
1436,"After almost 3 and a half years they still do their job perfectly, just some missing chrome from the track/volume buttons and the outer skin of the pads peeling off.",537
1437,I have a small head and have never really liked ear buds because they make my ears really sore after a short time.,537
1438,1 is the cord is very short.,537
1439,Bought this model upon recommendation from a friend who had used the previous model for about a year.,537
1440,I will recommend it to anybody who like me has a constraint budget.,537
1441,"Here's a list of Pro/Cons:

Pro:
  1) The sound quality is great.",537
1442,It sound like one of the sides was starting to have distortion in it.,537
1443,"Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones.",537
1444,"This was accomplished by using the following steps:
Power off the headphones, Press + ,  and the Pairing button (center)  all 3 simultaneously for 6 seconds.",537
1445,"When using to talk on a phone call, they have great clarity and work very well.",537
1446,As a telephone - sound quality when receiving and sending - I was not as impressed.,537
1447,Maybe it's because I wear glasses.,537
1448,But the effort is worth it with the Kinivo 240s.,537
1449,"This is a wonderful product for me, as I where hearing aids and can't wear in-the-ear bluetooth.",537
1450,He said the sound was great compared to most sets he's had.,538
1451,"I can hear everyone very clearly on my Samsung S5, and they can hear me.",538
1452,My wife has been using BTH 220 for 2 years without any issue so i decided to order the newer version.,538
1453,Just the quality Sony put into these $20 headphones!,538
1454,"For the price these are the best wireless headphones I have ever found, the battery lasts for weeks, the sound quality is good, and the on headphone volume and song scroll controls are quite responsive.",538
1455,"For the price, you really can't beat it!",538
1456,I am looking forward to the increased time I can use the headphones (up to 10 hours?),538
1457,Great for wearing for long periods of time!,538
1458,We got these headphones for our hard-of-hearing members of the congregation.,538
1459,After owning these for several days now I could not be more pleased.,538

1463,I tried to like these.,538
1464,Very happy with this product.,538
1465,It has very good bluetooth connectivity.,538
1466,Thinner would be better.,538
1467,"Hopefully with further tweaking, the snugness of the fit and consistency of the audio quality can be improved in future models.",538
1468,For $25 bucks they're damn good.,538
1469,I wanted wireless to minimize the clutter on my body when I go out for the ride.,538
1470,They're adjustable and they still fit my tiny head.,538
1471,"If you are just using it for hanbds free the battery will last for days, then recharges in an hour.",538
1472,I listen to Rap/Hip-hop and Metal/core/screamo style music.,538
1473,"But as they are, I cannot recommend them.",538
1474,I purchased them to listen to audiobooks on various devices.,538
1475,But my apple earbuds have lasted much longer than that.,539
1476,I had already purchased the Kinivo BTH3 headphones for at work and wanted an economical solution for those random times when I just want to get away from all the other noises at home and focus on my computer.,539
1477,"Out of the box before even charging, this just paired with my Samsung Galaxy S3 instantly.",539
1478,"Only once did someone say I sounded a little far off, but with a minor adjustment of the right earpiece, they said I sounded fine.",539
1479,"I thought she was old enough for this style rather than just ear buds, and for the cost of a modest set of buds, these are really good-sounding, well-designed headphones.",539
1480,"I used them for several hours every day, and only charge them up once a week.",539
1481,Don't buy these if you like your music loud!,539
1482,Love this headphone that I bought 2 of them.,539
1483,"They're a little big at the back, so when I lay flat it does get pushed a bit, but not uncomfortably so.",539
1484,"It came in the mail quite fast, sounds really good looks really good.",539
1485,I bought the Kinivo BTH240 Headphones approximately one year and 3 months ago primarily for work.,539
1486,I did have some concerns about the comfort of the back neck piece however I do not even feel it most of the time.,539
1487,I was cleaning the walls of my house.,539
1488,"Overall, I'm a happy customer.",539
1489,It's pretty darn gross.,539
1490,What I really love about them is that I can control my iPhone or Apple watch music functions with the buttons on the side of the ear cover.,539
1491,Really Love it Rather Spend 20$ for decent headphones like these than 200$ or more for beats!,539
1492,"just bought these headphones and they work pretty well, the only little cons of them is the short wire length and they look weird when wearing them.",539
1493,I have worn these on an airplane and could hardly hear the jets.,539
1494,No complaints at all.,539
1495,"Just like the price of these headphones, the quality is also low.",539
1496,There are other Sennheiser options in the sub-20 dollar range that have much better sound than these.,539
1497,Seem to eliminate background noise somewhat as well as people can still understand me when I'm out walking around my plant.,539
1498,"I'm no expert, but in the quiet of my room audio quality was excellent.",539
1499,I just want to upgrade.,539
1500,I have bought two sony headphones in my lifetime.,540
1501,Even Sony considers the mdr v150's to be in the caliber of their professional studio headphones.,540
1502,The 240's i'm dissappointed with.,540
1503,I would have returned it but due to my own fault I purchased them and didn't open the box until after the return window was closed.,540
1504,The only negative thing I can say about the headphones at this time has to do with the rubber piece covering the charging plug.,540
1505,This way I can set my phone at a central location where I am working out and keep listening to tunes.,540
1506,"I got them last year for my birthday and usually with headphones, they don't last for a long time.",540
1507,"The sound is great in these things and they're not very expensive, either.",540
1508,Seem ambient enough.,540
1509,"It's kind of a PITA, as I leave the headphones at work and I have to re-pair first thing in the morning, after every meeting, when I return from lunch, etc.",540
1510,"Update 2/11/15 ...

Just bought another set of these.",540
1511,Will be getting a lighter pair next.,540
1512,the sound is amazing quality is good and i loved the price you cant beat under 20 for sony headphones.,540
1513,"This is an un-necessary glitch for  what I previously considered the best portable blue-tooth headphones, including the unilateral  in-ear-piece models, I have ever owned.",540
1514,Would buy again.,540
1515,The padding on them makes them very comfortable.,540
1516,I expected better from Sony.,540
1517,I tethered the locking velvet pouch to the outside of my back-pack for easy access and to keep them safe from my textbooks.,540
1518,This headset is excellent except for the muffled at times when i talk to someone.,540
1519,Item shipped and was delivered quickly.,540
1520,"But actually, it is not!",540
1521,"I am purchasing another pair today so I can have a dedicated unit for work, I am confident my old pair will continue to perform for the next year so in my locker they go!",540
1522,I'm going to put a piece of tape over it and hopefully that solves the problem.,540
1523,and they also look awesome when i work out!,540
1524,I used these for about a month until the battery died.,540
1525,Bought this for my daughter to use on her tablet and in school.,541
1526,BTW its only day 1 so I will follow up with how they hold up in the long run.,541
1527,"I bought this obviously for 3 reasons: cheap price, positive average reviews, and the brand.",541
1528,They also have more volume than these kinda hollow tinny sounding ZX100s.,541
1529,I don't have a little head either.,541
1530,They ended up being a little hard to hear since they don't block out background noise.,541
1531,"I bought this as a recommendation from Matt Ogus, professional bodybuilder.",541
1532,The cable and plug are also very sturdy.,541
1533,I'm a runner and I've been going through ear bud style headphones like crazy.,541
1534,I don't use them every day but I have had these for 2 years almost and they are going strong.,541
1535,I would not recommend this to a person who plans to wear headphones for more than 45mins per use.,541
1536,"Quality of the voice calls - not sure about that, but people hear me.",541
1537,These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've owned.,541
1538,"I have not done a phone call with this, so I cannot attest to how well you'd sound on the other end and vice versa.",541
1539,I like them better than beats.,541
1540,I have had them for over a week and have not had to recharge them yet.for the price they are the best investment with superior sound quality.,541
1541,"With that out of the way, I think they are a better value then what I paid.",541
1542,"What we got was impressive sound (sure a set of $300 headphones probably sound a little better, but not much), and impressive durability.",541
1543,"Sound is very good for an on-ear model, and you can wear them for quite awhile without discomfort.",541
1544,And the finishing BEST feature of these is the price.,541
1545,These went back.,541
1546,I recommend these to all people,541
1547,Nothing sounds distorted or shrill.,541
1548,"A good fit over the ear is also a bit difficult to achieve if you have a smaller head, and I suspect if you had a larger head as well.",541
1549,I only read the negative reviews so I could find out the quirks that most users found with them.,541
1550,"They're definitely not the greatest headphones, but the sound quality IS good for the price.",542
1551,They also lay flay which is nice for travel.,542
1552,you get what you pay for...,542
1553,"I guess they are worth the 18 bucks, but not much more.",542
1554,"back on they go...she is disabled so i,m glad to have  something of good quality that she gets so much joy from,  and at a reasonable price,  thanks again.",542
1555,I paid $12 for these and they are great.,542
1556,"These headphones are all you need, unless you have a uncontrollable urge for paying too much and have to show thee world you can afford paying for a very fancy shipping box.",542
1557,"Build quality is great cord length is actually perfect comfort is excellent, but the sound quality is most important.",542
1558,It has been AGES since I ordered these and they still work!,542
1559,So if it has perfect sound...I can't judge.,542
1560,These can be bought for prices as low as $14 or $12.,542
1561,then you'll be fine.,542
1562,I think I paid around $20 for these headphones and they are excellent!!,542
1563,These are the best On-Ear headphones that I have ever used.,542
1564,It's a bit of a challenge for me to get the bands hooked over my ears.,542
1565,"It's not the most comfortable experience if you wear glasses, and it makes leaning your head back uncomfortable.",542
1566,I am returning this and will look for something better.,542
1567,"I listen to a lot of different styles of music, from alt.",542
1568,"if i had to choose the price, i would price it at $34.99.",542
1569,"He is 11 and they fit him well, and now we do not have to listen to his YouTube videos about Minecraft, etc.",542
1570,"It isn't much weight, though.",542
1571,Used them for about 3+ hours today while on the stationary bike and they didn't feel uncomfortable even after.,542
1572,It was a great purchase.,542
1573,They are also great for air travel.,542
1574,I'm really happy with this product.,542
1575,A design plus is the red band on the right side.,543
1576,The music comes back up at the volume level that you were listening to prior to the call.,543
1577,The sound is good enough for general listening.,543

They are also very comfy.",543
1579,"For the price you cannot do any better on Amazon, believe me I've checked.",543

1581,Fit is good for adults with an average to above average size head.,543
1582,"I've used the headsets for two straight business days running for 10 hrs straight on both days before I had to recharge the headset, that is excellent.",543
1583,I went back to using my $20 wired headphones.,543
1584,"Despite the sound and price, I don't recommend these headphones, due mostly on the design issues.",543
1585,(they sounded a lot better) I went back online to find a pair of the rocketfish.,543
1586,I finally got it to sync.,543
1587,I got this product around Christmas and  has served me really well so far.,543

1590,I was pleased that my headphones had arrived ahead of schedule.,543
1591,"If this isn't a problem, this would be a good choice for  you.",543
1592,Good quality and the great design help at a good price helped me enjoy them and use them as frequently as possible.,543

1594,They were tested out with 2 iPhone 5s and the new iPad w/retina display & a Dell laptop.,543
1595,In the past I' ve had to throw away more expensive headsets because it felt like my jaw was in a vice.,543
1596,"If you want fashion, buy beats, if you want function, buy sony.",543

1598,"Daughter's gave out a week ago, so they lasted about 8 months.",543
1599,Best investment ever!,543

Just bought another set of these.",544
1611,I would characterize my head size as average for an adult male.,544
1612,They worked great and lasted at least a year.,544
1613,So far so good.,544
1614,"Iron Maiden, Reel Big Fish, and The Smashing Pumpkins all sound horrid and bland on these.",544
1615,"The sound quality is fine, not amazing but it will do.",544
1616,these are at a great price and work great i think i may buy another pair.. the only thing that takes a little getting use to is the behind the neck idea.. but other than that they have a great sound quality and an even greater price....,544
1617,Don't get me wrong I love this product and I went safe and purchased the product from amazon not a seller.,544
1618,"My coworkers often make comments about my ""fancy headphones,"" but at this price I don't worry about leaving them at work overnight.",544
1619,I just wish they included a carrying case so i could just throw it in my backpack.,544
1620,I would say this is a very nice pair of headphones for the price you are paying for them.,544
1621,Will be picking up a second set for myself so I can listen to some tunes at the office.,544
1622,"The white ones are nice in appearance and I liked the red stripe on the right hand side, which makes knowing which side is which very easy at a glance.",544
1623,"So great, some jerk at work stole them from me.",544
1624,"Too bad, they're nice headphones otherwise.",544
1625,I had to purchase a second one because of that.,545
1626,This means there's some degree of noise insulation.,545
1627,I also have had and used similar type headsets like the Rocketfish RF-MAB2.,545
1628,I use it for running and walking.,545
1629,I really wanted these to work since I've been trying to find comfortable headphones for running for a while.,545
1630,But there are other affordable options out there that perform a little better.,545
1631,I bought three pair because I like them so much.,545
1632,I should have instead ordered the navy since white catches stains real fast.,545
1633,"Either that, or I have abnormally large and sensitive ears.",545
1634,The cord is perfect for me but that is because I am short so the cord is not super long for me.,545
1635,It's a little annoying.,545
1636,"I am about to purchase a black for my boyfriend actually,
because I don't want his hands on mine lol",545
1637,I had discovered with the 220s that I had to have my phone in my right front pocket for a steady connection because the receiver for the headphones is in the right side.,545
1638,Now the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone I have are worthless.,545
1639,But I'll survive.,545
1640,crackles and bucks a bit.,545
1641,"I'll be one of the dissenters who says they sound good, but not as good as the MDR-V150s they replaced.",545
1642,"The only things I would note are that they feel a bit flimsy and the ""sony"" logo wore off the side within a week.",545
1643,"These Sony headphones, while not fancy, certainly fit the bill.",545
1644,"Pros:
> The speakers can swivel and rest flat.",545
1645,But they are really a no go because they're just so uncomfortable to wear!,545
1646,The quality of the sound is very decent considering the low price point of these headphones.,545
1647,gonna order a couple more on payday,545
1648,Not to mention they look pretty snazzy.,545
1649,i have seen the same review given by other people and it seems that they make this headphones just to rob money from people.,545
1650,Maybe it's because I wear glasses.,546
1651,As I expected of a Sony product and more.,546
1652,"I say, if you want brand A quality then buy brand A.",546
1653,If you wear these headphones for to long they will make your ears red and sweaty plus really soar.,546
1654,I just got them today and they are not bad at all; good sound output and good looking.,546
1655,I love these headphones.,546
1656,"The plastic is just porous enough to take to sharpies, paint markers, and stickers, so you can customize them to your heart's content.",546
1657,I purchased these because I have gotten up from my desk far too many times - completely forgetting I was attached to computer by a headset jack - these certainly solve that problem!,546
1658,I will not claim that these are the best headphones ever or underrated in any way because they don't have superb bass or tempo in comparison to the top brands of headphones.,546
1659,"If you want cheap headphones to just throw on, go for it.",546
1660,Definitely not a phone issue as I tried it with several other devices.,546
1661,"The price is so good, that I had trouble justifying paying the same amount for a protective case for them, so they won't get banged up in my backpack.",546
1662,I am a male with a neck size greater than 18 inches.,546
1663,These headphones are just whatever.,546

1669,"I use them mostly in the gym, and signal is strong.",546
1670,"Unfortunatley, the design for staying on the head is not very good.",546
1671,I use it for biking to work and listening to music or podcasts.,546
1672,Hold down the center button on the right ear pod until the LED flashes red and blue.,546
1673,I do not recommend for adults.,546
1674,Sound is clear.,546
1675,"I'm very careless with my gym bag, so it's my own personal precaution.",547
1676,These seem like a great buy and well made.,547
1677,"The company is not aiming to produce a pair of stellar-quality headphones at under $20, just a pair that will suffice for the average user.",547
1678,Works fine with the phone function and with Siri.,547
1679,"As many said in other review,  these headphones are a bit large.",547
1680,Sound not too bad though but won't recommend for training.,547
1681,"I do feel them on my ears, but it is not uncomfortable.",547

1690,Pretty good sound.,547
1691,"Sounds beautifully, but the cord is just too short.",547
1692,"That means the laptop is either on my coffee table, sofa, or my lap.",547
1693,This is my 2nd pair of BTH240 headphones.,547
1694,A great headset at an affordable price.,547
1695,I would definitely buy them again!,547
1696,Sound quality is acceptable for avarage not demandable user.,547
1697,I usually don't have any issues with these headphones.,547

1699,I really like these!,547
1700,"Able to use these with my computer, iPad, and iPhone, no issues.",548
1701,People mistake it from dre.,548
1702,These headphones are very light and easy to transport.,548
1703,I feel like a little more width around back might help give a better angle that wouldn't pinch my ears.,548
1704,"For this price, that's fine.",548
1705,"couldn't stand it, so i stuffed toilet paper in a plastic bag and wrapped it all up in duct tape.",548
1706,"That said, the instructions for all of these tasks were abundantly clear.",548

1711,"#1 TV audio for me, #2 keep the wife tuned out.",548
1712,These are my first ever Bluetooth headphones.,548
1713,I bought these because I'm a hooper and I like to practice in the wee hours when everyone else is asleep.,548
1714,"From day 1 they were uncomfortable, but manageable and with decent sound.",548
1715,"I wasn't about to pay $200 for a pair of Beats for her, these look nice, and work very well for the price.",548
1716,I remember how much I loved the first pair I bought so I decided to purchase them again to compliment my droid incredible.,548
1717,"2.  not a huge problem, but the 240's are thinner than the 220's by a good margin.",548
1718,Item is bent out of shape so I cannot even return it.,548
1719,They are also very comfortable to wear.,548

1722,"I'm sure some people could care less about that, so take my review for what it is, my opinion.",548
1723,Spend the extra 10-20 to get some sturdy headphones with padding.,548
1724,"The combo sounds clear, lows are present but not pronounced some what tinney but I wasn't expecting a high end product so it's good for a quick fix or road trip, get them at walmart  $30.00.",548

1726,This is a great product!!!,549
1727,I'm going to be replacing these headphones in a matter of days so I thought I'd give them a review.,549

1729,Definitely a great buy!,549
1730,"Sometimes I will remove just one side so I can have a quick conversation with someone, letting the music continue rather than hitting pause.",549
1731,"This set can be stored away flattened, you simply turn the phones in sideways.",549
1732,But these are the best so far with good highs and lows and bass is good and the treble is about mid range and they work very well with a high end media player too.,549
1733,These have a small flashing blue paired light and not even noticeable.,549
1734,"Got these a long time ago, still kicking.",549
1735,So I rate 4 stars.,549

1741,"In addition, they are bulky and don't allow for leaning on anything.",549
1742,With in the fist week I had them the right speaker blew for no reason and when I called to get the exchanged the customer service sucked so bad I hung up right in the middle of it,549
1743,I will not claim that these are the best headphones ever or underrated in any way because they don't have superb bass or tempo in comparison to the top brands of headphones.,549
1744,Great little cheapo headphones.,549
1745,If anyone knows where I can buy a cushion over the top of these please contact me chkaczsn@yahoo.com,549
1746,They are well built and have held up to anything I have put them through.,549
1747,"The headphone is functioning properly,good sound,good mic reception, easy to configure.",549
1748,Great price for a pretty ok sound.,549
1749,"Rather sturdy, feels like it won't break too easily, I'll let you know how that goes.",549
1750,Sound wise they equal to much more expensive headsets but this problem is enough to turn you off.,550
1751,I bought these to replace a pair of soundbot bluetooth headphones I purchased about 10 months previously.,550
1752,I listen to the audio books from my IPhone and I Pad.,550
1753,"I received a 3.5mm male jack, but have easily fixed this foible with an adapter for $0.90.",550
1754,For the past 12 years I've always bought LabTec 820's but since they've stop making those I had to resort to these headphones.,550
1755,I've used these headphones off and on for a couple of years now with various devices (both phones and tablets) and haven't experienced any trouble.,550
1756,"I just purchased them, so there's not much on durability yet, but the cord seems pretty sturdy so there's a slim chance of that breaking or being stripped of the insulation.",550
1757,It doesn't matter where - they are simply great!,550
1758,"Sits comfortably over the ears, no problem using it continously for long hours.",550
1759,"Without a little ear bud that I have to drill into my ear, avoiding earring studs, they rest very comfortable around my ears and don't make me feel like I'm doing a wax extraction every time I remove them.",550
1760,"I do not like though, that it is not compatible with my flip phone (my backup) but it is compatible with my Iphone (my everyday phone), so I'm ok with that.",550
1761,"When they arrived, with other things that I had ordered, the headphone package was open, the edges of it were all worn and torn.",550
1762,I suspect that has more to do with Windows 8 being a terrible OS than anything else.,550
1763,"Kinivo has it's game on, and they even sent me an email immediately asking if I received on time and how were they working.",550
1764,I darn near consider em a wannabe beats headset.,550
1765,They sound great for the price and are very durable.,550
1766,I finally decided to look on Amazon and these looked highly recommended and for $25 I didn't think I was taking much of a risk.,550
1767,"I have bought many pairs of ear buds, all painful.",550
1768,They sound better than competing headphones in the under $50 range.,550
1769,It's a bit of a challenge for me to get the bands hooked over my ears.,550
1770,I have enjoyed them while listening to hours of Pandora at my desk without any notice of inferior sound quality.,550
1771,These are not bad headphones for the price.,550
1772,I would rate more purchases but only bother to if I really like them or really hate them.,550
1773,"All other affordable headphones have only lasted me a few months, so, needless to say, I was very pleased with this pair.",550
1774,You can't beat these for the price.,550
1775,"I thought it was just me, but both my brother and my mother had the same problem as well.",551
1776,Enter Kinivo BTH (behind the head I assume?).,551
1777,I have purchased these headphones twice and I am 100 percent sure that I will not buy another pair of over the head headphones from another company.,551
1778,Definitely a good buy.,551
1779,The sound is great and easily the most value you will find in a quality set of headphones in my opinion.,551
1780,The wires are so tiny and thin that they easily get damaged.,551
1781,If only my unit delivered on the praise that all of the others held it up to be.,551
1782,Got for my boys for Christmas.,551
1783,"I use them as my everyday ones now, and they are very comfortable.",551
1784,"Very satisfied with this product and performance - Light weight, comfortable padding for long use, long lasting battery and relatively inexpensive compared to other similar products.",551
1785,Battery life is amazing!!,551
1786,"The range is good, the price was great, and they sound quality is nice.",551
1787,I bought three pair because I like them so much.,551
1788,"The most I can say in this case is that I got what I paid for...no more, no less.",551
1789,I finally decided to look on Amazon and these looked highly recommended and for $25 I didn't think I was taking much of a risk.,551
1790,"Only three stars because these feel even cheaper, and fit worse than a pair I received for free for promotional purposes, with a hospital's name on them.",551
1791,one word amazing!!,551
1792,Sounds are well reproduced with full bass and high trebles.,551
1793,"I purchased this Bluetooth headset to replace a Sound Bot headset that worked but always seemed clumsy, cheap and looked a bit dorky.",551
1794,It is compatible with Apple products.,551
1795,I was very surprised to experience the sound quality was just great.,551
1796,I am happy the ear pieces turn for storage.,551
1797,"What I like - inexpensive, fits comfortably, syncing easily with Apple products, inexpensive, lightweight, comes with bag, inexpensive, buttons are accessible, stays put while running, buttons are logical, and inexpensive.",551
1798,"I purchased a pair after being impressed by my fiance's, and when he lost his, he stole mine.",551
1799,Just bought a second pair so my wife can listen to her audio books!,551
1800,"Maybe I got a defective product or something, but the volume that I hear things on this headphone is just way too low and because of that it makes it seem like I am listening to everything through muddy water.",552
1801,Better volume and overall fit and finish than prior model.,552
1802,"It is not super quality, but for the price it is OK.",552
1803,I had hoped to use them on airline flights but the background noise made it too difficult for me to hear dialog.,552
1804,"Excellent head phones..In fact I still have them after 5 years,ear padding is a bit worn out but the sound is still so good..",552
1805,I told everyone I know about this product.,552
1806,"If you're just looking for decent headphones for occasional use at a reasonable price, these are worth your consideration.",552
1807,I use them at work all the time.,552
1808,(The working part of the aids are outside the ear.),552
1809,"The sound from these headphones is phenomenal, I love that they're white in color, and they're comfortable on the ears.",552
1810,But the best thing of all is the price - $25!,552
1811,she crapped out on she so soon in less than a month  tried fo retuen it but it was going to cost $19 to return almost the same amount to.purchase it.,552
1812,"But actually, it is not!",552
1813,Obviously the quality isn't great compared to high end models but for the price they are a great buy.,552
1814,Very comfortable headphones.,552
1815,The new ones feel cheaper - including thinner and shorter cable.,552
1816,but i figure thats a given with the behind the ear.,552
1817,A real plus is that I can war them at home and not have to have my phone close.,552
1818,"Range isn't as far as the 220
2.",552
1819,The only problem is they should use a better quality covering over the foam ear muffs.,552
1820,Now the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone I have are worthless.,552
1821,"When I listen to all my favorite song's the  sound's on this Sony stereo headphone's are great you can hear the music more,it tune's out any other sound around you.",552
1822,It does not fit to charge it!,552
1823,"Taking into consideration the price I bought it for, $15, it is by far one of the best for its price range.",552
1824,They come with a long cord which is convenient for the purpose of their use.,552
1825,And the finishing BEST feature of these is the price.,553
1826,"These headphones are wonderful, I can do all those things and more and not have to worry about a cord getting tangled or tying me to my phone.",553
1827,"Overview: These Sony Stereo Headphones don't have any sound quality, comfort, or build quality (everything you want in headphones), but they are cheap.",553
1828,He is constantly taking phone calls as well.,553
1829,"We went through countless ear buds and headsets, most would last a week if we were lucky.",553
1830,"Don't expect to get the best pair of headphones ever, but I've found that they're probably worth at least 30 or 35 dollars.",553
1831,"The adapter is L shapped and bulky so if you have a case on your device (we are using a tablet), it is difficult to plug into it.",553
1832,The only thing I didn't like was that after a bit the top of my head where the band goes across gets warm ... but that also happens if I so much as wear a hat.,553
1833,Each charge gives about 2 days worth of listening.,553
1834,"However noises in front of me overpower my voice, possibly due to the microphone hole facing forward?",553
1835,"Overall, I would recommend these to anyone and if these ever break, I will be back for another pair.",553
1836,"The Good:
Well built.",553
1837,I don't have a little head either.,553
1838,"After about 7 years of heavy use, the plastic/vinyl on the ear cups is starting to peel away.",553
1839,"At this price point/quality, these headphones are unmatched.",553
1840,"I can hear everyone very clearly on my Samsung S5, and they can hear me.",553
1841,"Good sound, fine bass that does not overpower the mids and highs.",553
1842,also the controls are easy to access.,553
1843,this has been resolved with the 240.  the blue led light has been muted significantly.,553
1844,Bass is actually quite well and you will enjoy listening to your music on these.,553
1845,"Three qualities are most important to me in any set of headphones: Durability, Sound Quality, and Comfort.",553
1846,Another issue is the swivel on these.,553
1847,Hope this review isn't to confusing and if you have questions please ask!,553
1848,"I use them on my bike trainer so I can watch TV without having to turn the volume up to 100, and I don't have to adjust them every 5 seconds.",553
1849,"Since these are not in ear, when you put the volume pretty loud, other people can hear your music.",553
1850,Pretty comfortable.,554
1851,The midranges and the highs serve to add dimension and overall they are biased pretty well.,554
1852,"Also for my MP3 player, like I said they do drain the batteries kinda fast.",554
1853,"They're not exactly power performers, but then again, you're paying less than $20.",554
1854,I got her the Motorola S11-Flex HD headset at the same time and she hasn't even tried that headset yet because she is so pleased with the Kinivo.,554
1855,My earbuds are stronger and are more comfortable.,554
1856,"Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones.",554
1857,"The sound quality is fine, not amazing but it will do.",554
1858,"If value and quantity are important considerations, you won't go wrong here.",554
1859,"Not that I was using them... oh, which brings up another good point!",554
1860,Overall I have to say that I do like the headphones.,554
1861,"They're great for that, and so much more.",554
1862,"They are light, they work, they fit my head, they have decent sound quality.",554
1863,"For the price, I don't think that these 'phones can be beat.",554
1864,My original pair of BTH240's were great.,554
1865,I assume the headset's connecting wire  is supposed to ride along the back side of the neck or head.,554
1866,As I expected of a Sony product and more.,554
1867,"As for ambient sounds, when you are wearing them, they are a bit muffled, but not blocked.",554
1868,Sound is Muffled like it needs more power to drive it?,554
1869,"Gave to my 12 year old grandson and he was so very excited, spent the rest of Christmas vacation with them on his head listening to music almost all the time.",554
1870,Just note that isolation is nonexistant on this one.,554
1871,I wasn't expecting a whole lot for $25 so I am pleasantly surprised.,554
1872,"Battery life is almost amazing, I haven't really even had to worry about it much.",554
1873,All the buttons were unresponsive and the headset wouldn't shut off.,554
1874,"Not my first choice when I am chillin at home and listening to Drake or Coldplay but since hands free is the standard for drinving now and wires just plain suck, these headphones hit the mark.",554
1875,"But otherwise, perfect.",555
1876,Only foolish people with too much money pay more than this for headphones.,555
1877,I'll definitely be buying these again!!,555
1878,"The sound is quite good even on a crowded airplane; the padding around the ears is very comfortable, but also hasn't peeled or frayed.",555
1879,I can't wait to wear them to the gym tomorrow:),555
1880,and the sound is EXCELLENT!!!,555
1881,The privacy of knowing that my TV viewing is not disturbing anyone.,555
1882,"But again, it lacks the hardshell protection from heavier objects.",555
1883,ADDENDUM: Just used my Kinivo BTH240 wireless headphones for the second time in the gym and I experienced A LOT of cutouts and interference this time.,555
1884,"It's tolerable and does not cause a major issue, it's just a minor noticeable thing.",555
1885,Hurt my head within 15 minutes.,555
1886,So after eliminating issues with the devices it only leave the headphones.,555
1887,This hurts after a short time.,555
1888,It was bound to happen one day but I was expecting a longer life time from the rest of these reviews.,555
1889,"Please do yourself a favor and grab a pair of these, you won't regret it.",555
1890,This is the first brand that is affordable and he has NOT had any problems with the cords losing connection on the ear pieces.,555
1891,The design is great.,555
1892,We are talking here about a $25 Headphone.,555
1893,"Bass is nice and clear, beat's quality without the hype and 100x price tag.",555
1894,I haven't tested with any music loaded on my device but will certainly report back if I see any issues there.,555
1895,After two days of having them the right side of the headphones stopped working.,555
1896,contacted kinivo's customer service and the rep emailed me a return label.,555
1897,Bought these specifically to use with my Dish Network Hopper.,555
1898,The only thing that is hard to navigate is the volume and next track buttons.,555
1899,I love being able to watch movies or tv shows without bothering my wife or other people.,555
1900,People on the other end of the phone can't even tell I'm driving a truck.,556
1901,I purchased these because I have gotten up from my desk far too many times - completely forgetting I was attached to computer by a headset jack - these certainly solve that problem!,556
1902,This makes the headset unstable and renders the unit useless.,556
1903,Decent earphones for a fair price.,556
1904,I have tried everything I can think of to get a better fit but have so far not found anything that works.,556
1905,"I find myself having to use the Small Speakers equalizer on my iPod to tame the treble, which I never have to do with MDR-V150s.",556
1906,"Also the headband isn't padded, it's just plastic.",556
1907,My husband finally tested it and discovered that only the left side worked.,556
1908,"This is my 2nd pair, the sound quality, comfort, and overall feel is just second to none for the very affordable price.",556
1909,Overall solid headphones nd great value for the price.,556
1910,"Battery last all day, it's great!",556
1911,"For the price you're paying, you're probably not going to get much better quality than this, that said, there are a few issues, namely, no volume control on the headset itself, sometimes sound is a little weird til you tinker with the cord.",556
1912,Hold down the center button on the right ear pod until the LED flashes red and blue.,556
1913,But if your like me then I bet you will be satisfied with the average quality.,556
1914,"If it does, nothing tape can't fix.",556
1915,"I guess what they say is true, you get what you pay for.",556
1916,"Not the most expensive, but decent enough to listen to music with no issues.",556
1917,I can't understand how these are so highly rated.,556
1918,The sound wouldn't come out after that mishap.,556
1919,I would have given it 5 stars.,556
1920,"Also, nobody mentionned it, a (very) short limited warrantly of 90 days is provided.",556
1921,"Cons:
- not adjustable.",556
1922,Just recently started to experience distortion in one of the ear pieces.,556
1923,"I thought they sounded great, I'm sure others are better but these are so cost effective I could buy a pair for less then $30 which is amazing.",556
1924,"It's certainly adequate, but impossible to describe as loud.",556
1925,"as far as fit and comfort is pretty good considering I have a large head

only con is its not blue tooth 4.0 or bertter",557
1926,I gave this a 4 star because when walking outside I sometimes lose the connection.,557
1927,"Even though they wrap around the back of the head, they still stay on through my routine.",557
1928,IF this is product is an indication they are back.,557
1929,I should have instead ordered the navy since white catches stains real fast.,557
1930,They are totally worth it and if your worried about them not looking pretty they are very stylish.,557
1931,I sweat too dam much and these have held up pretty good.,557
1932,First off let me say I did not give this 5 stars because of its hi fidelity sound.,557
1933,Color: Black I have purchased 3 of these and one has lasted for several years.,557
1934,These are the best On-Ear headphones that I have ever used.,557
1935,"Over the years, the cushion that rests on your years has turned into flakes so now I have the sponge material left over.",557
1936,They also have more volume than these kinda hollow tinny sounding ZX100s.,557
1937,"Even if these broke, I would probably invest in a second pair.",557
1938,"They compress my ears too much, and the band presses against my skull behind my ears to the point that I can only wear them for an hour or two before I have to take them off for a while to let my head decompress.",557
1939,This is good for slim and medium size people only.,557
1940,"I was better off listening to my iPad with the volume turned up, then using these headsets.",557
1941,The sounds is ok but not good/very good or excellent.,557
1942,5 stars because of the combination of product and customer service.,557
1943,"If you need a pair for only 1 year, these are fine but don't expect to use them for 3 or more years, because they will disintegrate on your head",557
1944,If you can find the right sized replacement.,557
1945,"The sound quality is fine, not amazing but it will do.",557
1946,Not sure if the issue is rough use or manufacturing.,557
1947,I bought these headphones for $25 at a local hipster/nerd store that I frequent.,557
1948,One of the speaker has stopped working and I can't use it any longer.,557
1949,"My previous headset, an LG HBS-730 had significant issues in this area, and I'm very happy to say the difference between the two headsets is night and day.",557
1950,But after 1 day of use I can hear a rattle as if something is loose in the right earpiece after just 1 day of use.,558
1951,i recommend these.,558
1952,"These head phones are good quality, you can hear clearly.",558
1953,"Update 3 Sep 15

1956,The headphones work well and its not too loud.,558
1957,I'm a runner and I've been going through ear bud style headphones like crazy.,558
1958,Love the fact that they are very stylish and look more expensive that the retail price however the sound it's too low I have to turn up all the volume in order to have a nice sound,558
1959,"I recommend these to anyone that wants a good, affordable pair of headphones!",558
1960,It came on time as well.,558
1961,"That said, the instructions for all of these tasks were abundantly clear.",558

1972,These headphones are the most uncomfortable I've ever owned.,558
1973,"I was really blown away when I first listened to these, because they greatly exceeded my expectations.",558
1974,"There is a soft feel to these headphones that integrate with the body, on the head and too in perception of sound that just feels natural, ergonomic in the highest sense of that term, again in relation to the price.",558
1975,Great bass sound.,559
1976,I would not recommend traveling with these.,559
1977,- The good thing with these is these will work with both cell phones and PC's.,559

1979,Bought these for my kids in school and I didn't want to spend a lot for school supplies.,559
1980,They look great and connect easily.,559

1982,"So all the similarities are there, someone said the size of these protruding are smaller than others but i found them to be the same.",559

1993,I purchased the Artic P311 and Kinivo BTH204 together.,559
1994,crackles and bucks a bit.,559
1995,"I got some earbuds after that, but honestly I hate them more than anything, so I was so happy when I found these on Amazon.",559
1996,I bought them because reviews on amazon said they were of the same quality of Beats by Dre.,559
1997,"I wish they had a better grip though, as in a month they started to fall down if I picked something up.",559
1998,"It seems like they have definitely worked the bugs out of these, at least for my use.",559
1999,No matter what brand.,559
2000,"I think either the technology is still evolving or better technology is still costly or else, speakers at this cost are meant to be this way.",560
2001,"yes for the price as many said, these are real nice but bottom line is the clarity wasn't close to even my flimsy apple airbuds so these are going back for that reason.",560
2002,I have owned the BTH220 model and have loved them.,560
2003,It sticks out and just dangles in the air like a wild hair.,560

2019,"I felt they were very comfortable as well, lightweight etc.",560
2020,"Although the cord is a little shorter than I would like, it's still slightly longer than the cord on my Apple earbuds they replaced.",560
2021,This seems to be common for a lot of these inexpensive headsets.,560
2022,It's not like the professional ones but it is great quality for the price and it may just last longer for me than my Behringer ones that only lasted a year and I payed more for!,560
2023,"maybe i'm crazy, but for $20 these sound 95% as good as anything else out there.",560

2040,The white is pretty classy in my opinion.,561

2042,and I had it for a year now its been up with my nieces pulling and them sitting on top of them and I will say its put up with all that abuse lol.,561
2043,Connected to most systems.,561
2044,I'm rough on headphones.,561
2045,No PIN; they rely on a pairing mode for security.,561
2046,My head's just a little larger than they were designed for.,561

2049,This is the first brand that is affordable and he has NOT had any problems with the cords losing connection on the ear pieces.,561
2050,"I bought this and the bth220 headphones and they have great sound quality and the first charge they lasted at least 16 hours, so with wear and tear over time I'm sure the 8 hour rating they give them will more than hold true.",562

2069,I'm amazed at the stereo separation achieved with a wireless signal.,562
2070,"FINALLY, we have it!",562
2071,yeah you can get beats for like a million bucks but why do that when these are just as good.,562
2072,The only issue I have ever had is after 5 years of continuous use and abuse the headband has become loose (grip wise) so when I bend down they have a tendency to start slipping off.,562
2073,"If you are just using it for hanbds free the battery will last for days, then recharges in an hour.",562

2085,"However they are definitely the best cheapest headphones I have ever used, and I will be buying the updated model from Sony.",563
2086,I have bought Bluetooth headphones before and they were always poor sounding when bass kicked in.,563
2087,This item was delivered promptly and as agreed on.,563
2088,"I've only had them for a couple of weeks and only have one small complaint, while running, I have the volume down to a lower level, I can hear one of the buttons rattle.",563

2091,"They work fine for music, but for you tube or vine DO NOT use these they are laggy and uncomfortable to wear.",563
2092,"are very comfortable, I like the color green, but on the picture they see green with white, and when they arrived they were green with beige, but equally the use that is given is good, we like a good buy",563
2093,"and as much as I love Amazon, I don't love over paying if I don't have too.",563
2094,I widely recommend the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Headphone.,563
2095,For the price a quality product,563
2096,*Update* I had to buy a new one at three and half years but I bought the same ones again because they pair so well and I had no issues with them.,563
2097,Ripped it apart and installed in some better headphones.,563
2098,Use them mostly for listening to music.,563

2100,"Obviously I can hear well enough or I would have replaced them, but still.",564

2102,"If you're an active person, save yourself the money and grab a pair of these amazing headphones!",564
2103,Spend the extra 10-20 to get some sturdy headphones with padding.,564

2108,Will see how it holds up long term.,564
2109,"My husband ordered them for me, and I won't wear them.",564
2110,"My older cousin, who knows a lot about headphones, said these sound better than her $70 headphones.",564
2111,Price is okay for the quality.,564
2112,The band is worn in the back of the neck so it's out of the way and you forget they are even there!,564
2113,They cannot safely be tossed into the bottom a backpack.,564
2114,The sound is okay but they are quite uncomfortable to wear.,564
2115,"Good quality, great price.",564
2116,"I always tell it like it is, the bad along with the good.",564
2117,"Not only is the sound quality excellent (again, not compared to Sennheiser or other premium brands), but they are also amazingly durable.",564
2118,"Removing the consideration of price, I give these 3 stars.",564
2119,If you read these reviews you would think otherwise.,564
2120,"It's a little harder to understand people that are talking to you, but you'll hear that they are talking if you're not blasting music.",564
2121,These are great.,564
2122,"I am not a professional dj, and nor is my daughter;)",564
2123,They have rich deep bass and incredibly clear treble!,564
2124,I also really like the buttons on the side for adjusting the volume; they're perfect for when you're listening to music away from your computer.,564
2125,But the best thing of all is the price - $25!,565
2126,The okay: I must have small ears.,565

2134,"If you want cheap headphones to just throw on, go for it.",565
2135,"I have, some years ago, bought these headphones and they have held up well, I will probably buy them again one day.",565
2136,"For headphones that cost $14, Sony's WDRZX100 Outdoor Headphones are solid.",565
2137,Because the headphone is not adjustable to your head i try to put the plastic piece over my ears which hurts after a while.,565
2138,For the price these are fantastic!,565
2139,"After a day...
PROs: Comfortable headset (sure beats ear buds), good sound quality, easy to set up.",565
2140,I would recommend byting this with such price.,565
2141,"It's pretty interesting, I am a Sony guy, TV's, Playstations, Phones for years.",565
2142,She absolutely loves them.,565
2143,Quality Headphones for the money.,565
2144,One thing to be aware of when turning off the power to the headset.,565
2145,"That being said, I needed these for listening to lectures and classes online and didn't want to put much money into it.",565
2146,The sound is decent nothing to heavy as far as bass which is fine because the noise cancellation makes up for some of the downsides.,565
2147,Build quality is nice as well; sturdy plastic.,565
2148,I used at least 4 days a week.,565
2149,This slight adjustment in design makes the control of the headphone much easier and more useful.,565
2150,"However, if you want to use these headphones to eavesdrop on people, it's a five-star product.",566
2151,"Having said all that, I blame myself, not the headphones.",566
2152,"I think that it was designed for a no longer satisfaction, i don't want buying another one, i'm afraid i lost my money.",566

2156,They are very comfortable.,566

2158,"Plus, if I lost it, I could find it by outputting music to it.",566
2159,The headset came nicely packaged and there was a USB charging cable provided.,566
2160,I use them almost every day for at least an hour.,566
2161,You don't have to go through that process every time.,566
2162,I have no idea whether any of that is due to the headset or the cell phone I'm using.,566
2163,"They certainly do not compare to Bose in sound quality or comfort, but for the price, the sound quality is quite good and they appear to be reasonably durable.",566
2164,They are very light and compact as well.,566
2165,Kinova has a complete line of products and a site for browsing and support.,566
2166,Still very much worth it if you don't mind having no isolation with the music off.,566
2167,When they did work they did a decent job for the price but always had a rattling in the right ear and didn't block out much noise.,566
2168,"They compress my ears too much, and the band presses against my skull behind my ears to the point that I can only wear them for an hour or two before I have to take them off for a while to let my head decompress.",566
2169,I have been using these headphones for months and they are still in good working order.,566
2170,After looking for a while Igave up and just bought cheap... WELL little did I know that they would be just what I wanted.,566
2171,"The new Apple earbuds stay in my ears pretty well, but the wire is a hassle during a workout.",566
2172,"Also, nobody mentionned it, a (very) short limited warrantly of 90 days is provided.",566
2173,"They are low, really low compared to the Sony MDR-V150.",566
2174,"At the price point I bought them I didn't expect much, a few months of kids beating on them at most, and I expected decent sound but not much more.",566
2175,These headphones are a pleasant surprise.,567
2176,"As for quality of material and comfort, I would like to give these headphones a 4 out of 5 on quality of material.",567
2177,I need head phones to listen to my ipod.,567
2178,They sound great for the price and are very durable.,567
2179,"In fact, the performance is as good, or even better, than more expensive models under a 100 bucks (i had tested quite a few before buying these).",567
2180,"Panasonic RP-HT21, no question, every single time.",567
2181,"I've had these for two days now, and I love them.",567
2182,"Unless they fix the firmware issues with these headphones, I would pass on these.",567
2183,The head size is decent (I have a big head and it fits over my head comfortably).,567
2184,So a nice design.,567
2185,use them every day.,567
2186,The over-the-ear design works great -- they stay firmly attached even when I am moving about.,567
2187,Low battery chime that rings every 40-60 seconds until unit is charged.,567
2188,This is the only headphones my daughter does not break within two weeks.,567
2189,"i don't use headphones alot and wasn't going to spend over $100 for a pair,this pair i like a lot, good sound,not to loud but loud enough,i use it at the gym",567
2190,"If you're looking for a solid set of 'phones at a low price, you simply can't do better than this.",567
2191,These look odd on me so I wear mine alone.,567
2192,"Smooth deep sounding bass, clear, crisp treble, almost no distortion at very high levels (not recommended).",567
2193,"They made it all the way to Friday afternoon again... My previous headphones would last two days and crashed & burned permanently after a hard workout...
Definitely will buy again if the ones I have ever fail!!",567
2194,I must say my head is all of 71/2 in.,567
2195,I loved them so much I wore them out.,567
2196,These headphones are comfortable enough that I can have them on for hours without experiencing any discomfort.,567
2197,Husband loves them really good working.,567
2198,Would definitely buy again.,567
2199,"Also for my MP3 player, like I said they do drain the batteries kinda fast.",567
2200,"Love that fact you can actually skip songs on itunes and Pandora, something units couldn't do a few years back.",568
2201,"That, combined with a great many calls where the headset abruptly dropped connectivity with a loud ""PANG!""",568
2202,"Frame is little bit loose or weak, so it is comfort but easily come off.",568
2203,Been using it like 6 or 7 hours while I jog and no problem so far.,568
2204,I'm a teacher at a small alternative high school with students who have major behavioral issues.,568
2205,The base response is good.,568
2206,"I use both BOSE at home, and this product when I travel.",568
2207,I find the little red indicator that tells which side is the right side very handy and thoughtful too.,568
2208,"Normal use for it is something like ""Hardball,"" but last night I listened to a blues online radio site and the thing delivered spot-on sound.",568
2209,I think when using on a mobile device the quality of the sound is not as good as when you use it on the computer.,568
2210,great for those days when the maintenance guys are using the leafblowers.,568
2211,"The Sony Stereo Headphones that I purchased from Amazon are just what I wanted to use with my I-Phone 5, from which I access music from my Amazon cloud.",568
2212,I ended up immediately purchasing Bose AE2i's and am extremely happy with them.,568
2213,I was still using my sony earbuds when I ordered these and I am definitely sticking to the brand now.,568
2214,The 240's i'm dissappointed with.,568
2215,They are very comfortable.,568
2216,"For around $20, the sound quality is excellent, and would certainly recommend these to anyone looking for a VERY GOOD set of headphones, that just happen to be inexpensive.",568
2217,It seems to me that they last wayyyy longer than 10 hours.,568
2218,In my opinion these are so much better than the crap beats by dre.,568
2219,"The audio sounds great, it holds a charge for a very long time, and paired immediately.",568
2220,The headphone jack is really sensitive and you will be fighting with it.. twisting it so the sound doesnt go away.,568
2221,Because I really like the headphones a LOT!,568
2222,UPDATE 12 JUN 2015 - My headphones are completely dead now.,568
2223,"I would NEVER buy the Beats for two hundred dollars, these work just fine.",568
2224,I discovered that the sound quality was noticeably poor if bearable.,568
2225,Overall I have to say that I do like the headphones.,569
2226,"Sony has had their ups and downs over the years (eh hem, PS4...), but at least they are unwilling to license their name to a total piece of junk.",569
2227,"The sound quality is good, blocks out other people who are also in the gym.",569
2228,I bought this color and the white one for my kids that last longer than other brands.,569
2229,"I just purchased them, so there's not much on durability yet, but the cord seems pretty sturdy so there's a slim chance of that breaking or being stripped of the insulation.",569
2230,"2) When used longer, it tends to get really warm in your ears.",569
2231,Packaged well and arrived quickly!,569
2232,"First of all, the way these fold up makes them relatively easy to carry around, but they are still bulky, and prone to folding out again accidentally.",569
2233,There was a lack of bass compared to my Sony MDR-XB500's.,569
2234,"The ones I had were actually Sony, and more expensive than these headphones!!!!",569
2235,"Not noticeable at first, but you have to pay attention.",569
2236,"For the asking price, these are excellent quality and a fantastic value.",569
2237,"This can happen even if I'm right next to my phone and outdoors, so I'm not sure if that eliminates the Bluetooth and cellular connections as the culprits.",569
2238,"I listen to a lot of different styles of music, from alt.",569
2239,"It's OK if you are listening to loud music, but for softer stuff not so much.",569
2240,I have not got to the end of the battery yet and I pretty much use it all day long so it has great battery life.,569
2241,He is a big man and they fit his head nicely with the adjustable sides.,569
2242,I love being able to watch movies or tv shows without bothering my wife or other people.,569
2243,They seem way more robust than the V150s too.,569
2244,"It could be made comfortable if it were adjustable, but it isn't.",569
2245,"The sound is great, almost complete noise canceling.",569
2246,"Comfortable, great for bike riding, fits with helmet.",569
2247,"The phones fold/flatten to a nice compact size, great for smaller bags.",569
2248,Headset was portable and folded and it included a micro-usb cable and a microfiber carrying pouch.,569
2249,..All at 20 dollars?,569
2250,"However, my son loves them.",570
2251,"They are small, so the sound quality is not what you would get with a good pair of speakers or headphones and fall out of your ears.",570
2252,"As for noise reduction, that doesnt work at all.",570
2253,My old ones had a longer cord but for the price they are still very good.,570
2254,"Now he can walk around the room, listening to music, while his iPod is charging.",570
2255,"Purchased for my teenager who knew she wasn't going to get the $200 headphones, and she's very pleased with them.",570
2256,These can be bought for prices as low as $14 or $12.,570
2257,"I would have easily paid double for these headphones, and still given them 5 stars.",570
2258,Only done side a little more bass would have been nice.,570
2259,I paid 29.99 for mine and I can't find anything wrong with them.,570
2260,Fit is good for adults with an average to above average size head.,570
2261,"As usual, the cord seems to be about 6 inches shorter than I need.",570
2262,Stretching them out helps for a while but even the loosest setting was not enough for me.,570
2263,i say get them in black because they can get dirty but easy to clean.,570
2264,My son wanted these so he got them.,570
2265,"I had to run the last 3 miles without my auditory motivation, which I absolutely hated.",570
2266,"In conclusion, a great deal (in my opinion), with some nice touches.",570
2267,"They are moderately comfortable, but can get a bit painful when using them for a long period of time.",570
2268,Drowns out the crazies on my morning bus commute.,570
2269,"The sound from these headphones is phenomenal, I love that they're white in color, and they're comfortable on the ears.",570
2270,It's OK if you're not very picky about the sound of your music.,570
2271,Volume and Track control right on the ear for great hands free use.,570
2272,Highly recommend.,570
2273,So far so good with these.,570
2274,Even though the functionally a good  the build quality is not sturdy.,570
2275,"Cheap feeling, stiff, and basically NO bass whatsoever.",571
2276,Well made and very very durable so far after about 2 months of daily use by a 3 and 8 year old.,571
2277,I gave these only 4 stars simply because I don't have any high-end sets to compare them with.,571
2278,"Again, they're pretty cheap material, but they can hold their own.",571
2279,Its a decent product but not what i was looking for.,571
2280,These work excellent in an office work environment or at home.,571
2281,I use the pair they have at my office and after twenty minutes my ears hurt.,571
2282,The band is worn in the back of the neck so it's out of the way and you forget they are even there!,571
2283,"These head phones are good quality, you can hear clearly.",571
2284,I use these for connecting to a home receiver for watching movies to keep from upsetting sleeping family.,571
2285,I recommend buying these.,571
2286,I was hoping they would balence out more and give better quality but that never happened.,571
2287,"If your thinking Beats or Bose, just try these first and save your self an arm or a leg.",571
2288,I love that they fold and come with a storage bag which means it can be stored easily in my gym bag.,571
2289,It's not uncomfortable but it does feel like they're going to get pushed off your ears if you're laying back against something.,571
2290,"Good for music and calls , do not recommend for work outs, they fit behind the head and have a tendency to fall off .",571
2291,"I did shake my head and they didn't fall off, but I still had the uneasy feeling about them.",571
2292,"After four years of use, I have not once regretted purchasing these headphones.",571
2293,If you wear these headphones for to long they will make your ears red and sweaty plus really soar.,571
2294,"I have bought many pairs of ear buds, all painful.",571
2295,"If you wear a larger hat size, these headphones are probably not for you.",571
2296,"This meant that I couldn't hear very well because the sound wasn't actually directed into my ear, but more into the lobe region of my ear.",571
2297,The earbuds are heavily padded and soft as well.,571
2298,In fact I can go outside and clean the ice and snow off my vehicle and still get excellent sound.,571
2299,I bought a black pair to go along with the black stage dress protocol.,571
2300,The Koss PortaPro is still my all-time favorite bargain headphones.,572
2301,":)

My little guy likes them also!",572
2302,Just bought a second pair so my wife can listen to her audio books!,572
2303,The cable and plug are also very sturdy.,572
2304,"I could probably talk anyone out of the SoundBot and Sonys, but the last two are neck and neck (no pun intended).",572
2305,I have tried them out and can't find a thing wrong with them.,572
2306,"When sitting down and my phone resting on the table, I've never experienced any inconsistencies.",572
2307,I wouldn't even consider them as an upgrade from standard ipod earbud quality.,572
2308,"Really Sony, 3 ft?",572
2309,"They're not high end headphones by any means, but they sound great for the price and they don't seem to randomly stop working after 8 months like other low price headphones do.",572
2310,Only think I wish it did was fold up for compatibility... Other than that I'm a satisfied mommy!,572
2311,Scares me real bad and is annoying.,572
2312,im going to keep these until i decide if i want to get better ones!,572
2313,"These headphones are Better Sounding, (better balance; highs are crisper/less muted), Better Quality, Better Fitting, Pair Easier, oh, and are HALF what I paid for Rocketfish...  Major Home Run!",572
2314,They replaced a large pair of highly rated Photive over the ear Bluetooth phones (which broke) at half the price.,572
2315,"They really are ""good enough"" and honestly better than anything else you'll find for under $40.",572
2316,If you just want to enjoy your music and want headphones that are durable get these instead.,572
2317,These headphones have good sound and nice quality for the price.,572
2318,"I bought them for my son to use in school, but everyone (including my son) wants to use them at home.",572
2319,They seem to have a better Bluetooth signal than the 220.,572
2320,"In conclusion, a great deal (in my opinion), with some nice touches.",572
2321,I do recommend these headphones for general use.,572
2322,"I've had them for several months (to make sure they didn't short-out like some of the reviews have claimed),and I am totally pleased.",572
2323,"At this moment, I am listening to music on my GNote with this headset and I am hearing both excellent treble and bass.",572
2324,"The sound is pretty good and when I use it to make calls, I've had no complaints about the microphone quality.",572
2325,I needed new headphones because my last pair (a different brand) started only to play in one ear which many headphones do to me since they take a lot of abuse from me.,573
2326,Great little cheapo headphones.,573
2327,Would definitely recommend in a situation like mine.,573
2328,They are super comfortable.,573
2329,"For the price, great deal.",573
2330,"My only complaint is that they're not that great at blocking out external noises - on a crowded bus or subway, I have to turn up my volume almost all the way to hear my music properly.",573
2331,"I had high hopes, but this just didn't get me there.",573
2332,"So great, some jerk at work stole them from me.",573
2333,No deep bass like Bose but good dynamic sound & switching to phone calls is seamless.,573
2334,It holds the charge the whole time I've used it too.,573
2335,Cheap and effective.,573
2336,"It is pretty hard to press, making it difficult to turn and off and making it easy to give the wrong command.",573
2337,"When you need to block out the background sounds of dorm life or the city while you're doing your own thing, these headphones do a wonderful job with general noise.",573
2338,I been through countless headphones and none have lasted as long as these are lasting.,573
2339,I can't hold the ipod in my hand all the time.,573
2340,The fit is comfortable as well and do not feel like they are putting your skull in a vise yet there is no danger of them falling off.,573
2341,"My complaints are mostly about how they are built:  The cord is extremely short, even shorter than the MDR-V150, and it's taking some getting used to.",573
2342,My only 'con' would be length of the cable.,573
2343,I have been constantly using it for over 10 months now and it still charges as new and has the same sound quality ... !,573
2344,Then u have to keep wiggleing it to get it on both sides...  is any one else's like that?,573
2345,The headphones are also secure enough to not fall off when you're doing bench press.,573
2346,"Ears eventually start hurting from wearing too long
3.",573
2347,"I get a crazy long range, maybe about 100-150 feet from one end of the plant to the trailer bay.",573
2348,It gets the job done for the price one thing that is annoying is that you have to pair it every time you use it you can't just turn on your bluetooth and go like others after pairing it the first time,573
2349,*Update* I had to buy a new one at three and half years but I bought the same ones again because they pair so well and I had no issues with them.,573
2350,LIGHT TO HOLD AS WELL.,574
2351,"In terms of sound, I'd say that they are about the same quality.",574
2352,"I have never owned a ""behind the neck"" set of headphones.",574
2353,It's no longer so white but that is expected.,574
2354,I am sure it would work fine if I wanted music playing on it the entire time.,574
2355,"These headphones are Better Sounding, (better balance; highs are crisper/less muted), Better Quality, Better Fitting, Pair Easier, oh, and are HALF what I paid for Rocketfish...  Major Home Run!",574
2356,I wouldn't even consider them as an upgrade from standard ipod earbud quality.,574
2357,But these are the best so far with good highs and lows and bass is good and the treble is about mid range and they work very well with a high end media player too.,574
2358,I find the ear piece to be very comfortable.,574
2359,"It could have been a number of things, like my phone had too many apps on, Pandora lost connection or something, but I never experienced those problems while on a corded headset.",574
2360,I've had mine for two years and it's still going strong!,574
2361,The headphones deliver good volume with decent fidelity -  perfect for watching movies.,574
2362,Only thing that is on the bad side (and it may be a similar problem with other headphones) is how to keep the cord tied down to the headphones when not in use.,574
2363,I bought these because I like to keep up with fashion and ear buds don't stay in my ears.,574
2364,"The sound is good and it works as it should, but it's a bit tight over the ears and it's a bit uncomfortable when wearing sunglasses since both would rest over your ear.",574
2365,I'm a runner and I've been going through ear bud style headphones like crazy.,574
2366,They have met all my expectations...,574
2367,"If you are not serious audiophile, you'll be reasonably happy.",574
2368,I like the compact size as well.,574
2369,"as expensive but they are so fine, that you should just buy two.",574
2370,5 stars because of the combination of product and customer service.,574
2371,"Kinivo has it's game on, and they even sent me an email immediately asking if I received on time and how were they working.",574
2372,I have to sit directly in front of the stereo on the floor to use them.,574
2373,Much better than the earphones I just paid $120 for and plan to return.,574
2374,"The MDR-V300s also have 30mm drivers, but they have a better magnet, which I assume makes a big difference.",574
2375,Even though the functionally a good  the build quality is not sturdy.,575
2376,Telephone calls are very clear.,575
2377,"When I told him what I paid, and what these normally cost on the electronics aisle at Walgreens (maybe $20), he asked for a pair of his own.",575
2378,"The most I can say in this case is that I got what I paid for...no more, no less.",575
2379,You just can't complain at this price.,575
2380,"Unfortunately, due to a terrible ear infection, I'm not supposed to be putting anything in my ears (including earbuds) for a very long time, if ever.",575
2381,The Artic seems better on the bass range.,575
2382,"It's OK if you are listening to loud music, but for softer stuff not so much.",575
2383,I been through countless headphones and none have lasted as long as these are lasting.,575
2384,"I wouldn't recommend them for DJing or producing, since they do not at all have ""Studio Quality"" sound.",575
2385,"FINALLY, we have it!",575
2386,"For the price, you can't beat these headphones.",575
2387,I hope these never stop being manufactured because I love them!,575
2388,He thought he'd never find one like it.,575
2389,I was very disapointed with the sound - needs more treble!,575
2390,Easily paired to my android phone and stays in place while I workout.,575
2391,They are perfect for my needs.,575
2392,I highly recommend these to anyone!,575
2393,These are not bad headphones for the price.,575
2394,Overall it is a good product that I use on a daily basis!,575
2395,"For Sony these are good headphones for the price tag, had them for about 6 months they are good sounding they have alright bass but very clean highs.",575
2396,"Great product here, Kinivo!",575
2397,These would definitely be that product.,575
2398,"Secondly, the ear cups don't swivel nearly as much as the older ones did, which makes it difficult to place them on your head.",575
2399,"I bought them for my son to use in school, but everyone (including my son) wants to use them at home.",575
2400,It needs charging probably once or twice a week with regular use.,576
2401,I've owned a pair for over three years now.,576
2402,"Also, the - well, I don't know the name for it, but the thing that connects the two ear-phones, can contact the back of my neck when I look up, which also moves the unit a bit.",576
2403,I hate them because they're not that strong and sometimes it only plays in one ear.,576
2404,"the ear piece is kinda small so it doesn't fight over your ear, just press against it, like I said the ear piece is really soft and nicely made so it doesn't hurt, but after a while it does heat up my ear.",576
2405,"They gave me a bit of a headache when I first starting using them, but it was so worth it.",576
2406,Don't know what the big deal is for the expensive ones.,576
2407,"The only things I would note are that they feel a bit flimsy and the ""sony"" logo wore off the side within a week.",576
2408,With in the fist week I had them the right speaker blew for no reason and when I called to get the exchanged the customer service sucked so bad I hung up right in the middle of it,576
2409,Feels very comfortable.,576
2410,So far so good with these.,576
2411,It is very annoying.,576
2412,They sound good and block out quite a bit of the surrounding noise.,576
2413,The speaker is basically just smaller so it moves less air.,576
2414,The build is also excellent as it has structurally held up nicely.,576
2415,Especially for those looking for a set of headphones to be used while exercising or running.,576
2416,"I got them last year for my birthday and usually with headphones, they don't last for a long time.",576
2417,For the price worth the money.,576
2418,I had those same ones in white and they lasted 3 years of very heavy child use.,576
2419,I use these all the time at work and I think I charge it once or twice a month.,576
2420,I love that they fold and come with a storage bag which means it can be stored easily in my gym bag.,576
2421,Bought this a month and it was working well until today .,576
2422,I ordered another pair and they came right away.,576
2423,"Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.",576
2424,I could only hear through one side.,576
2425,I have tried everything I can think of to get a better fit but have so far not found anything that works.,577
2426,I would not buy it again.,577
2427,Perhaps this product is not designed to be paired with more than one item at a time.,577
2428,I was using wired headphones that didn't have a mic so I feel safer being out in the pre-dawn knowing I can call out at the press of a button on my headset.,577
2429,"Keeping in mind that you get what you pay for, these are actually pretty good.",577
2430,Just finally died after the battery did.,577
2431,It is perfect for taking outdoors.,577
2432,I highly recommend it.,577
2433,"I don't know what people are talking about, those who rate it like 1 or 2 stars.",577
2434,"When making calls, I can hear others and they can hear me, even with the windows down in the car.",577
2435,Very happy with this product.,577
2436,These are decent quality.,577
2437,"I was better off listening to my iPad with the volume turned up, then using these headsets.",577
2438,"I have more expensive on-ear and over-ear headphones for at-home listening or music production, but I didn't want to use them for outdoor activities for obvious reasons.",577
2439,"It was reasonably comfortable and the sound was surprisingly good, but the volume was uneven, the left side was noticeably quieter than the right.",577
2440,"When I told him what I paid, and what these normally cost on the electronics aisle at Walgreens (maybe $20), he asked for a pair of his own.",577
2441,"2.  not a huge problem, but the 240's are thinner than the 220's by a good margin.",577
2442,I read one review which states the cords tangle though there's not been a problem with either set I have.,577
2443,The battery lasts with average usage 10 or so hours.,577
2444,If anyone would find these painful it would be me.,577
2445,I've purchased three pairs of these for my kids (two pairs in white/pink and one in blue/black).,577
2446,Clear sound and good microphone.,577
2447,"They are fine for the price, but I would consider spending more for a better product.",577
2448,"I ordered these headphones for my son, 17 years old, a wrestler.",577
2449,"My light never dims, and the power never comes on when I unplug and hit the power on button.",577

2451,My reference system comprises Beyer Dynamic DT 990 Premium 600 OHM Headphones using Benchmark DAC1 to drive the Beyers.,578

2454,Once again Sony has proven to provide a good quality product for a very reasonable price.,578
2455,Overall it's a good product.,578
2456,These headphones are superb for the price.,578
2457,These are great for working out and stay snug on your ears.,578
2458,If you are looking for legit stereo sound without paying an outrageous amount these are for you.,578
2459,"I had just lost some pretty good headphones, but I wasn't really interested in an investment.",578
2460,"One star less because it is not in same league as those top of the line headsets but as I said, super value for money.",578
2461,I have no idea whether any of that is due to the headset or the cell phone I'm using.,578
2462,"Not my first choice when I am chillin at home and listening to Drake or Coldplay but since hands free is the standard for drinving now and wires just plain suck, these headphones hit the mark.",578
2463,They don't completely cover your ear but the sound quality is very well put together.,578
2464,"the small hole in my mac which apple calls as ""speaker"" sounds better than this.",578
2465,We could go through about 8 of these in a year and still not hit the prices of one pair of Beats!,578
2466,The Koss PortaPro is still my all-time favorite bargain headphones.,578
2467,The cable and plug are also very sturdy.,578

2472,I love these!!!,578
2473,I could not imagine having these in white.,578
2474,:)  These push against my cartilage after a while.,578
2475,"As you can gather from the title of this review, the product does not cancel noise.",579
2476,Sony's website lists them as not circumaural[0].,579
2477,And the finishing BEST feature of these is the price.,579
2478,I think they look stylish...we'll see if they agree.,579
2479,"but still not a bad buy for simple, yet good headset.",579
2480,"I have bought a hundred or hundreds...  of items on Amazon going back to when it was just books... these are very close to the best value for the money that I have ever purchased, period, not just on Amazon.",579
2481,"The frame is light, sturdy, and well-designed for everyday use.",579
2482,Absolutely horrible.,579

2484,I listen to mostly podcasts.,579
2485,"Thought about Motorola, but went with Kinivo.",579
2486,Fantastic value.,579
2487,but they cannot be comfortably worn around the neck as these can.,579
2488,Gave them to my husband hoping his larger head will stretch them out for me :),579

2499,I just wanted to get rid of the cord with traditional headphones because its always in my way when working out.,579
2500,This headphone isn't as loud as other competitors.,580
2501,Not a DJ-ing headset because of it's it limited mobility.,580
2502,I think when using on a mobile device the quality of the sound is not as good as when you use it on the computer.,580
2503,"They are comfortable, adjusts easily and i thought they were very affordable.",580
2504,"What I like - inexpensive, fits comfortably, syncing easily with Apple products, inexpensive, lightweight, comes with bag, inexpensive, buttons are accessible, stays put while running, buttons are logical, and inexpensive.",580
2505,"i wanna know if it's possible that if i send this back and they can give me a refund, or give me one that works.",580
2506,Very inconvenient.,580
2507,It was a great purchase.,580
2508,"Now, I figured since it was suck a bargain there would be a catch, and of course there was.",580
2509,I use them almost every day for at least an hour.,580
2510,It's easy to switch to accept or make a phone call.,580
2511,"The Sony ZX100 Over-the-Ear headphone with 30mm driver has about 24 ohms of resistance, requiring 50% more power to operate, but produces a more crisper sound response.",580
2512,"I'll have to continue using my older headphones over these, but I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.",580
2513,The greatest pair of cheap headphones.,580

2552,"After a day...
PROs: Comfortable headset (sure beats ear buds), good sound quality, easy to set up.",582
2553,The two sound differences these headphones have from the 150s are a) a slightly lower output and b) a slightly lighter bass.,582
2554,But I'll need to take anger management classes if I keep them myself.,582
2555,Highly recommend this product.,582
2556,"the pros:
1) light
2) good sound
3) good price
4) I can wear them with glasses doesn't bother me.",582
2557,"However noises in front of me overpower my voice, possibly due to the microphone hole facing forward?",582
2558,Easy to set up and control.,582
2559,It's just pure cheap!,582
2560,"They are easy to pair, work well with my Galaxy S4 and I like that you can raise the volume even though the phone volume has topped off.",582
2561,"So I suppose I need to order another one, if I can find a color other than blue, red or black that's not hot pink (not my choice of a color, thanks!)",582
2562,I purchased these headphones for my mom to use with her iPad and she absolutely loves it.,582
2563,Great value and performance.,582

2568,"For the rest of us, these are okay.",582
2569,"For the price these are the best wireless headphones I have ever found, the battery lasts for weeks, the sound quality is good, and the on headphone volume and song scroll controls are quite responsive.",582
2570,I bought the Photive BTH3 instead and wish I hadn't wasted my time these headphones.,582
2571,I am considering a second pair so I won't have to share.,582
2572,Great item for the price.,582
2573,And that's what I mostly listen to.,582
2574,These headphones have a great noise isolation and you just can't hear much else but your music.,582
2575,They are also very easily adjusted and can be changed around to fit your individual measurement.,583
2576,They connect to all my devices.,583
2577,The over-the-ear design works great -- they stay firmly attached even when I am moving about.,583
2578,You can only hear the voices.,583
2579,"They sound fine, and work okay if I am sitting still..",583

2581,He is constantly taking phone calls as well.,583
2582,"I use them with my iPad, iPhone, laptop and desktop units and they work perfectly, but sometime moving from one device to another can be a bit tricky, but attainable once you get used to them. . . .  bgs.",583
2583,"Keeping in mind that you get what you pay for, these are actually pretty good.",583

2586,Sound quality was moderate.,583
2587,"I'm no expert, but in the quiet of my room audio quality was excellent.",583

2591,"I did shake my head and they didn't fall off, but I still had the uneasy feeling about them.",583
2592,"I would have easily paid double for these headphones, and still given them 5 stars.",583
2593,Wonderful headphones.,583
2594,The product that came in the box looked alright but it was closed tight with just tape.,583
2595,"I would maybe recommend looking up modded upgrades with these phones if you want to push it further, sound wise.",583
2596,Also style is beautiful.,583
2597,I got this for an 2nd Gen Ipod Touch that has a problem with using the Amazon Basic keyboard (even though it's Blutooth).,583
2598,"Honestly, spend a little more money and get a nicer pair of headphones.",583
2599,Very decent headphones to walk around with and Enjoy your music .,583
2600,I have used these twice in major rain storms and haven't missed a beat!!,584
2601,Calling them something you would give to someone you don't see often.,584
2602,"great product i strongly recommend it, shiped very very fast it came in a day ahead, also it paired at once the voume is great and I use it on my galaxy 8 tablet",584
2603,"The 10 hour battery life isn't a big deal, as I only use them for listening to music at work, and I charge them overnight.",584
2604,"Behringer phones best sound output, bests the Philips, can handle volume, but emit vinyl fumes.",584
2605,Came quickly and works well!,584
2606,"When they work, they're fine, but they seem to lose their charge too quickly.",584
2607,I highly recommend!,584
2608,***The huge downfall to these headphones is there is NO OVERHEAD CUSION.,584
2609,"When I listen to all my favorite song's the  sound's on this Sony stereo headphone's are great you can hear the music more,it tune's out any other sound around you.",584
2610,It gets in the way when i am trying to write down notes.,584
2611,"What's even worse is that when the battery gets low, these will emit a series of loud beeps in your ears that signal the battery is about to die.",584
2612,Before I won new headphones I use these ones all the time.,584
2613,The Motorola's being to hurt the insides of my ears after extended wear.,584
2614,"I also have been using it at the gym for about 2 hours at a time, it handles great.",584
2615,The quality of the sound is very decent considering the low price point of these headphones.,584
2616,Bought these for my son.,584
2617,Wouldn't recommend to anyone hoping for quality with a low price tag.,584
2618,They have incredible quality and for $15???,584
2619,another thing i am a hardcore music lisitner  usually me ears start to buzz when im throu the first 4 hors but with these i could last 8 hors then i had to take them off for 30 min,584
2620,Tried it for a short bit around the house.,584
2621,I would buy these again.,584
2622,"All in all a good purchase when I got them, and they still are 4 months later.",584
2623,"I've had these headphones for less than six months and now the left side has blown out, for $25 I kind of expected more.",584
2624,If it turns out that it is just my phone and it works great on other stuff then yeah I would suggest it.,584
2625,"They are adjustable, they look great, fit great.",585
2626,They don't move around when I run.,585
2627,Only draw back is when they're on people can hear the music you're playing and I was looking for a pair of headphones that I can use while my son is napping or in the bed while I'm working during the wee hours.,585
2628,I have tried everything I can think of to get a better fit but have so far not found anything that works.,585
2629,My reference system comprises Beyer Dynamic DT 990 Premium 600 OHM Headphones using Benchmark DAC1 to drive the Beyers.,585
2630,"FYI, these are awesome but they do not fold unless I am missing something!",585
2631,I did think that the range would be better.,585
2632,What I really love about them is that I can control my iPhone or Apple watch music functions with the buttons on the side of the ear cover.,585
2633,They even fold up to stow away in my cargo shorts.,585
2634,They look like they belong with the iphone super good looking and solid Sony quality.,585
2635,The headband is way too rigid and totally uncomfortable.,585
2636,They are awesome!,585
2637,SONY consistently delivers good quality.,585
2638,"It would be nice if they folded into a travel pouch, but with all their other virtues plus the low price I'm not complaining.",585
2639,"Overall, I highly recommend them for the average listener, but not for the audiophile snob types.",585
2640,"Sound:
+ Mostly full range, loud, crisp and clear in most of the needed range.",585
2641,"It works great for that, as long is it only used for a short period.",585
2642,"Given the price, this should be expected.",585
2643,The only ones where 1. the don't hurt my ears 2.,585
2644,"They are small, so the sound quality is not what you would get with a good pair of speakers or headphones and fall out of your ears.",585
2645,"Unfortunatley, the design for staying on the head is not very good.",585
2646,"He says the sound is far superior in these than what we have in the bedroom, which at the time of purchase was the gold standard of wireless headphones.",585
2647,"if i had the chance and some extra cash, i will eventually switch to something more comfortable that i can wear for a long period for work.",585
2648,The actual make up of the product is of high quality as well.,585
2649,"Great little bluetooth headset, great price, extremely fast shipment, great battery life, and comfortable too.",585
2650,I purchased the white one for my mother and it looks classy!,586
2651,"I've only had them for a couple of weeks and only have one small complaint, while running, I have the volume down to a lower level, I can hear one of the buttons rattle.",586
2652,I got his Sony set and I love them.,586
2653,great headphones in my opinion better than beats but leak alot of sound and they fit well i have an afro and they are big enough to go over that so they please me and they handle bass well,586
2654,I am an editor and I use these for simple editing in coffee shops.,586
2655,I've been using this to listen to movies I watch on Netflix on my nook.,586
2656,"I purchased this set of headphones, in addition to the Koss UR-20, for use with my portable mp3 player.",586
2657,I am sure this is a good headset but not for what I needed it for.,586
2658,This headphones are unbeatable for this price.,586
2659,The jack is finicky and doesn't always connect to my computer right away.,586
2660,I saved a ton of money and the headphones audio is superb!,586
2661,There's now a rubber cover on the micro USB jack; added protection from the elements and looks better.,586
2662,"I have two of the older model, both after two years have the rubber/plastic stuff thats on the muffs pealing off.",586
2663,He's loves them.,586
2664,I should have instead ordered the navy since white catches stains real fast.,586
2665,I've had my pair for almost 4 years.,586
2666,I will return this product.,586
2667,They have a VERY CLEAR sound.,586
2668,If only my unit delivered on the praise that all of the others held it up to be.,586
2669,They sound phenomenal.,586
2670,"(about 48 inches long)
The sound quality is decent, not professional quality obviously but not that horrible flat sound you get with many ear buds.",586
2671,"From day 1 they were uncomfortable, but manageable and with decent sound.",586
2672,If that could get fixed I'd love these.,586
2673,I have no complaints about it and use it every day.,586
2674,"I love, love, LOVE these headphones!",586
2675,It syncs with my Galaxy Note 3 easily allowing me freedom from wires.,587
2676,Good quality earphones.,587
2677,I bought these so that my partner did not have to listen to my music.,587
2678,Money well spent!,587
2679,"So far, the overall operations are working well and this is a very nice headset for the price.",587
2680,These have a small flashing blue paired light and not even noticeable.,587
2681,"I'm partial to over-the-ear headphones, never could get used to uncomfortable earbuds.",587
2682,"Once i put them on, the sound was vivid and very clear.",587
2683,"For the asking price, these are excellent quality and a fantastic value.",587
2684,I will say that they are comfortable but as for connectivity it's not so good.,587
2685,It remembers the last 5 devices you paired with so once I have paired with all of my devices it will be a piece of cake to pair.,587
2686,"the small hole in my mac which apple calls as ""speaker"" sounds better than this.",587
2687,"Alas, they did not.",587
2688,I can leave my phone on the kitchen counter and still stay connected in the basement or upstairs.,587
2689,"It's pretty interesting, I am a Sony guy, TV's, Playstations, Phones for years.",587
2690,They sound good and block out quite a bit of the surrounding noise.,587
2691,The flat sound and bulky earpieces ruin the headphone experience.,587
2692,"they may be a bit ""old school"" but I have difficulty with the in the ear thingies  that come with phones and mp3 players.",587
2693,The Kinivo BTH240 is my 3rd pair of bluetooth stereo headphones.,587
2694,However they only look good if they are around your neck.,587
2695,"My husband ordered them for me, and I won't wear them.",587
2696,"#1 TV audio for me, #2 keep the wife tuned out.",587
2697,"Paired quickly and stays connected consistently, with good range.",587
2698,Sent them back thinking that they were a dud and ordered a replacement.,587
2699,Sent them back thinking that they were a dud and ordered a replacement.,587
2700,These sound just as good.,588
2701,I ordered these to use strictly at my computer because I wanted the household noise to be blocked out.,588
2702,The sound quality isn't so good but the looks and brand name of Sony alone make up for it.,588
2703,"At first, because these headphones are a little bulky, they got in the way somewhat and caused my earlobs to hurt when using them for an extended period of time.",588
2704,"Cons - Ears get a little hot with prolonged use, so I adjust them occasionnaly for a little more airflow.",588
2705,Microphone works well and can even be used with Siri.,588
2706,"In fact, the performance is as good, or even better, than more expensive models under a 100 bucks (i had tested quite a few before buying these).",588
2707,"If you are looking for a sport headphone, get Sony mdr-g45lp, it doesn't have bluetooth but at least it is lighter and cheaper and doesn't hurt.",588
2708,"On the downside, I have a wide face and normal human ears and it's a tight, somewhat uncomfortable fit.",588
2709,"Look, you are getting what you are paying.",588
2710,The cushioning around the ear is also very comfortable as well.,588
2711,"Over the years I used to spend about $20 every two months on earphones that get caught in spokes, suffer water damage, get frayed, experience impact damage, or just generally short out or stop functioning.",588
2712,I wasn't expecting  the sound to be so crisp and clear.,588
2713,"Bought this to replace an older model BTH240 (which was great), but this one is slow to connect, frequently drops out or outright disconnects.",588
2714,Two best features are the exceptional sound quality and very long battery life.,588
2715,I have already grown accustomed to not fighting wires.,588
2716,Great headphones.,588
2717,Ordered for my nephew.,588
2718,It's just where bluetooth technology is.,588
2719,"I'm very careless with my gym bag, so it's my own personal precaution.",588
2720,"I have two of the older model, both after two years have the rubber/plastic stuff thats on the muffs pealing off.",588
2721,"Also, while it is lightly sitting on ear, it also isolates the noise pretty well.",588
2722,They work great for the children in eliminating background noises & listening to their teachers.,588
2723,My biggest complaint is that I can't lay down with them on as the headband runs across the back of the head and is very uncomfortable to lie/lay on.,588
2724,"After a time, they do become a bit uncomfortable due to the tighter squeeze than an over the head style of headphones involve.",588
2725,I use these earphones primarily for watching TV while exercising at the gym or to listen to video clips on the computer.,589
2726,"Even though I have a fairly small head, they are tight.",589
2727,Not expensive but works great.,589
2728,This is my fourth set of these headphones.,589
2729,The first problem I noticed is the sound quality.,589
2730,I ended up donating them to our local thrift store after one use.,589
2731,The earpads rotate so it is more compact.,589
2732,Could just be my particular unit but other than that I'm really satisfied with my purchase.,589
2733,Love this headphone that I bought 2 of them.,589
2734,The 90 degree plug is bulky and  rather awkward.,589
2735,How you can get this much quality for such a low price.,589
2736,Those without such issues or not looking for any noise blocking qualities will love these headphones.,589
2737,The okay: I must have small ears.,589
2738,The connectivity was annoyingly frustrating when I took them to the gym.,589
2739,I am happy with the purchase overall and would recommend them -- just to someone with a bigger head or bigger ears.,589
2740,"It seems best for walkers, joggers, cyclists.",589
2741,"He love the audio books and movies available, and raves about the excellent quality of these earphones to everyone.",589
2742,Just got these a couple days ago and I'm very pleased.,589
2743,My son goes through headphones like crazy.,589
2744,Good for working out and casual listening.,589
2745,"Either that, or I have abnormally large and sensitive ears.",589
2746,"CONS---
There are none, I'm happy to report.",589
2747,Awesome BT headphones for a reasonable price.,589
2748,Sound wise they equal to much more expensive headsets but this problem is enough to turn you off.,589
2749,I was surprised on how good the bass was (for twenty something bucks).,589
2750,We have 3 pairs of these in our house as everyone kept stealing mine.,590
2751,"to make it even better the microphone is perfect, I took an audio clip with my iPhone's voice recorder and everything was completely clear (granted the house was quiet,) but I had no distortion or anything.",590
2752,"I was better off listening to my iPad with the volume turned up, then using these headsets.",590
2753,But the Sont MDRZX100's have really good sound quality.,590
2754,I wore these one day and did not know there was a car behind me.,590
2755,"I'd rather pay more for better quality, but even the more expensive ones from Sony that are similar to this, have the same problems.",590
2756,"I finally gave these to my granddaughter, I don't think she uses them, hers had mickey mouse or something on them making even them better than bth240 headphones.",590
2757,very comfortable.. easily pairs to my Sony Z3V which i love.. and the battery life is amazing..Kinivo did it right with these budget headphones..,590
2758,The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because they drop calls - even when you have a wifi assisted connection.,590
2759,"My son has autism so he is super picky about products he uses, and he really likes this one.. Super fast shipping!",590
2760,I read a bunch of reviews on the headphones and decided to give it a try.they work so well and cancel out noise unless you take it off.,590
2761,I've never really counted how long the duration of a single charge is but I'd like to say around 8 hours!,590
2762,Great headphones.,590
2763,Will update this review to let you know what I think.,590
2764,Came quickly and works well!,590
2765,I'm only glad that I ended up with black instead of the ugly green ones.,590
2766,"They are fine for the price, but I would consider spending more for a better product.",590
2767,"I don't think that will be happening anymore as I have been using these since they arrived and they are great, easy to pair up and fit well.",590
2768,"When the opportunity arose, I bought the ZX300 to see if there really was a difference.",590
2769,"At the price point I bought them I didn't expect much, a few months of kids beating on them at most, and I expected decent sound but not much more.",590
2770,These can be bought for prices as low as $14 or $12.,590
2771,"I would expect three weeks out of a pair of ear buds I got from the dollar store, but not from a well-reviewed, kinda pricey set of headphones!",590
2772,Didn't stay on my head as well as I would like when weight lifting.,590
2773,"They are super comfortable, I can wear them for hours and hours and not even notice them.",590
2774,I have worn these on an airplane and could hardly hear the jets.,590
2775,- They're adjustable.,591
2776,That didn't help.,591
2777,You will not get any appreciably better audio quality with more expensive headphones like Beats for 100s of dollars more.,591
2778,"But, as the title of my review stated, for a set of headphones under 20 bucks I did not expect them to be equivocal to 150 dollar headphones.",591
2779,MUSIC / CALL AUDIO QUALITY : The sound quality is very much acceptable considering the price you pay for this.,591
2780,Connected to ASUS PC via Polk Radio amplifier.,591
2781,I was looking for some inexpensive headphones that would give me good sound quality and this blew away my expectations!,591
2782,Pros - They are made for traveling.,591
2783,"My only complaint is that they're not that great at blocking out external noises - on a crowded bus or subway, I have to turn up my volume almost all the way to hear my music properly.",591
2784,The pause works great.,591
2785,The price makes this product even better.,591
2786,For a low end headphone the plastic is very sturdy and solid.,591
2787,"Additionally, there appears to be a type of AVL (volume limiter) built into this product.",591
2788,"But they look
pretty cool and i may recommend the seller.",591
2789,I am using these for watching movies.,591
2790,Pairing it to any bluetooth phone is easy.,591
2791,"They're small and would be a great size for a child, the sound quality is ok, it sounds a bit low and the bass isn't much, it doesn't sound like the 20$ sony headphones, this pair would be a step down from that.",591
2792,"Over a year and still work, purchased Dec 2015 and still sound great.",591
2793,The poorly designed bass response was also taken into consideration.,591
2794,"Also, it seems like it struggles to keep pace intermittently.",591
2795,Loud if you want them to be.,591
2796,Bass was lacking and vocals seemed muffled.,591
2797,"This may not sound like much to some, but in the world of audio and video, a one second delay makes content nearly unwatchable.",591
2798,They block background noise well!,591
2799,For the price these are great headphones upon first impressions much better sound and build quality then a pair of Walmart brand for the same price.,591
2800,"I am about to purchase a black for my boyfriend actually,
because I don't want his hands on mine lol",592
2801,It has been AGES since I ordered these and they still work!,592
2802,I will return this product.,592
2803,These have definitely delivered on this front.,592
2804,I wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid.,592
2805,"But you can also tell L/R by touch, on the outside, just above the earcup, the Left side has a dot, while the Right side has no dots.",592
2806,The other thing is to consider three taps to call as I double tap frequently switching songs and end up calling last number.,592
2807,These are decent quality.,592
2808,"This is an Awsome wireless BlueTooth headset, especially for the bargain price.",592
2809,My only complaint is with the fit.,592
2810,These headphones work really well.,592
2811,"RED is RIGHT; it makes it easy to know which way to wear the headphones, without looking for the tiny ""R"" and ""L.""",592
2812,"I am a smallish woman with a small head and small ears and there was no way to wear these comfortably, or even in a way that made them feel they would stay on my ears.",592
2813,There is no tin sound or echoes and they go very loud.,592
2814,Your guess is as good as mine!,592
2815,I was too lazy to return it which was my second mistake.,592
2816,"If you are not serious audiophile, you'll be reasonably happy.",592
2817,And the finishing BEST feature of these is the price.,592
2818,"My son loves this product, and it helps us not have to listen to him playing his video games on his computer.",592
2819,"Let me tell you, these things can take a beating.",592
2820,yeah you can get beats for like a million bucks but why do that when these are just as good.,592
2821,These came faster than expected!,592
2822,One star only because there's no negative.,592
2823,"everything is perfect except for the soft fabric inside, on top of the speakers.",592
2824,Music quality is good.,592
2825,I wish that the fit was adjustable.,593
2826,"For a Dark Side of the Moon session, you'll want better.",593
2827,"I didn't expect that much from them, but when my son (who is 8) started to rave about how awesome they are I had to try them out.",593
2828,I guess I was expecting more from these with such high stars and how many people have bought and rated them.,593
2829,things that i like and dislike are.,593
2830,I use them while running and they stay in place just fine.,593
2831,"Able to use these with my computer, iPad, and iPhone, no issues.",593
2832,I listen to a lot of audio books and love these ear phones for than.,593
2833,"I have enough slack to wear these headphones comfortably, but once in a while they get yanked off.",593
2834,"Since these are not in ear, when you put the volume pretty loud, other people can hear your music.",593
2835,"This is an un-necessary glitch for  what I previously considered the best portable blue-tooth headphones, including the unilateral  in-ear-piece models, I have ever owned.",593
2836,These have about half the distance before signal cuts out.,593
2837,the ear piece rotates side ways and long ways.,593
2838,"Also, the - well, I don't know the name for it, but the thing that connects the two ear-phones, can contact the back of my neck when I look up, which also moves the unit a bit.",593
2839,The sound quality is much better than the ipad ear buds I had been using.,593
2840,They stay put once adjusted.,593
2841,The speaker is basically just smaller so it moves less air.,593
2842,But I'll need to take anger management classes if I keep them myself.,593
2843,I did a lot of research before finally purchasing these and I am happy with my decision.,593
2844,I'm thinking there is a way to push a button or something to access the phone (Siri) but I have pressed all the buttons and still haven't been successful.,593
2845,These phones are just great!,593
2846,Highly recommended.,593
2847,"As the subject says, the poor audio cable caused crackling on the slightest movements.",593
2848,-The bluetooth signal is pretty good on these.,593
2849,Wish these were water resistant like the ones Kinivo recently pulled from the market (don't know why) but all in all these are a very good choice for this kind of head phone.,593
2850,"They work great, are light, and pair quickly with my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 tablets.",594
2851,They sound ok - especially after the in ear wired set I was using started to drive me crazy.,594
2852,These are my first set of bluetooth headphones and most of my use of these is listening to audiobooks on a Samsung Galaxy Note II.,594
2853,I have forgotten a few times and it lasted an additional week.,594
2854,It cancels surrounding noise very well.,594
2855,Your guess is as good as mine!,594
2856,They are super comfortable.,594
2857,I used this when I was running.,594
2858,the next time you go shopping.,594
2859,Love the feature that they fold flat for easy storage.,594
2860,"I had a pair of Koniva bth220, (which is an awesome pair) of bt headphones but they got ran over.",594
2861,It's just where bluetooth technology is.,594
2862,That may have more to do with my big noggin than anything else.,594
2863,I just want to upgrade.,594
2864,The sound is really not to be beat for this price.,594
2865,Got these for my son for school and they work great.,594
2866,"Overview: These Sony Stereo Headphones don't have any sound quality, comfort, or build quality (everything you want in headphones), but they are cheap.",594
2867,Thus far she is loving them.,594
2868,"Anyway, these work really well and seem like they would last a long time--if you keep them out of your mouth.",594
2869,(I must write at least two more words to meet length requirement.),594
2870,"Sound quality is clear if you don't need any true base, but overall they feel very cheap for Sony Headphones.",594
2871,The new headset paired immediately with my phone and tablet.,594
2872,"Out of the box before even charging, this just paired with my Samsung Galaxy S3 instantly.",594
2873,"As far as compatibility, the work with Windows Laptop, Windows Phone (1520 and 920 used), as well as any of our Samsung Galaxy devices.",594
2874,"They are comfortable, adjusts easily and i thought they were very affordable.",594
2875,Sound is clear.,595
2876,"I don't ever review, but these headphones are worth it.",595
2877,If you read these reviews you would think otherwise.,595
2878,I gave these only 4 stars simply because I don't have any high-end sets to compare them with.,595
2879,These are great headphones that block out outside noise and you need not turn the volume up to hear things clearly.,595
2880,I bought two sets of these for my children (ages 4 and 6) to use on an airplane with their kindles.,595
2881,"2) When used longer, it tends to get really warm in your ears.",595
2882,"Kinivo has it's game on, and they even sent me an email immediately asking if I received on time and how were they working.",595
2883,(Did I even spell bear right?,595
2884,Ordered for my nephew.,595
2885,"One Con:
I am working on finding the comfort factor for wearing them for extended periods as they go over the ears and rest on the back of my neck.",595
2886,These sound just as good.,595
2887,"So much that if I leave them on my ears for more than about 30-45 minutes, it starts to hurt.",595
2888,Overall it's a good product.,595
2889,These headphones were a waste of money!!!!,595
2890,You can wear them for a long time without getting a headache (also note that I have a big head and a lot of hair so this tends to be a problem for me).,595
2891,"I love that it adjusts, and it's easy to figure out which side is right vs. left (the red color goes on the right, by the way).",595
2892,"They gave me a bit of a headache when I first starting using them, but it was so worth it.",595
2893,I guess since they cover the ears they really block out a decent amount of outside noise leaving just music.,595
2894,Bought in January.,595
2895,"The ""Red"" band on the right side, denotes which ear which is good since it's very hard to read the symbols telling you otherwise.",595
2896,This is more subtle.,595
2897,"I even stopped at the computer in the store and read the reviews, thus prompted to go ahead.",595
2898,"Also, to everyone who buys $200 headphones: ""You got ripped off.""",595
2899,"I would maybe recommend looking up modded upgrades with these phones if you want to push it further, sound wise.",595
2900,These headphones are amazing.,596
2901,I hate them because they're not that strong and sometimes it only plays in one ear.,596
2902,Did I mention that they run for a very long play at peak volumne and they fold up nicely?,596
2903,"2014 CHristo as my Grandma purchased these head phones for me, they were great till late November of this year.",596
2904,"Unless they fix the firmware issues with these headphones, I would pass on these.",596
2905,"The sound these headphones deliver, for a quarter of the price of my Grados, is fantastic.",596
2906,I got her the Motorola S11-Flex HD headset at the same time and she hasn't even tried that headset yet because she is so pleased with the Kinivo.,596
2907,Great distance and battery life.,596
2908,freq response very good considering the low price.,596
2909,UPDATE 12 JUN 2015 - My headphones are completely dead now.,596
2910,The headphone are not the best in the world or even top of the line.,596
2911,"On the downside, I have a wide face and normal human ears and it's a tight, somewhat uncomfortable fit.",596
2912,"They could be uncomfortable if you have glasses, as the frame could get pressed against your ear.",596
2913,"I have owned many Koss's, Sennheiser's, Sony's, Audio Technica's, and even some Bose.",596
2914,I was look for an adjustment to decrease or increase the length of the neck band.,596
2915,"I would suggest buying these first, they're great for classical music, rock, and metal.",596
2916,The cord is fairly large so it doesn't get tangled and it very durable.,596
2917,He's loves them.,596
2918,It's neither good or bad.,596
2919,It's easy to set up and having all the controls on one of headphones is a big plus.,596
2920,"I haven't tried thee with my iPod or any other devices, simply because I bought them for use with my Macbook .",596
2921,If that is the purpose it is,596
2922,I had an employee there offer to actually let me try out a couple different pairs in the store before I purchased them.,596
2923,"In sum, it's a great deal.",596
2924,The sound quality in these headphones is excellent.,596
2925,Sound is pretty good for under $30.,597
2926,"I got two pairs, one for a friend in black and the white ones for me, he said that he really likes them because they sound very clear and have good bass.",597
2927,They really work.,597
2928,The sound is great and the battery life is decent.,597
2929,The headphones deliver good volume with decent fidelity -  perfect for watching movies.,597
2930,"Low cost, low quality.",597
2931,So far it works nicely but cant comment on the battery life.,597
2932,"They sound fine, and work okay if I am sitting still..",597
2933,"However noises in front of me overpower my voice, possibly due to the microphone hole facing forward?",597
2934,On Windows 8 it can be very difficult to figure out if you have bluetooth and how to turn it on.,597
2935,This is my recommendation.,597
2936,They simply hurt my ears after short periods of time.,597
2937,Pairing them with my cell phone and my computer haven't been a problem.,597
2938,I bought them for around $20 and it was honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made.,597
2939,"I didn't want to support the hyped up Beats, since they're very low quality and very overpriced, but I wanted something that would sound great and look sharp.",597
2940,So far so good.,597
2941,"The noise cancellation was much better than I thought it would be, so definite props for that on low price headphones.",597
2942,"I tried them also, they sound ok for a budget price set.",597
2943,They are great and he loves them.,597
2944,I purchased these in 2011 and are finally starting to reach the end of its life after 5 years of hardcore gym use and constant sweating in.,597
2945,"It seems like they have definitely worked the bugs out of these, at least for my use.",597
2946,I wouldn't waste my money on these due to the poor design.,597
2947,so why would i rate this thing 5 stars?,597
2948,"And for $20, you can't go wrong.",597
2949,They addressed my issue immediately and issued a refund.,597
2950,Folds up to make it an easy carry.,598
2951,For this price you can't ask for anything better.,598
2952,He states that the quality of sound is very good coming from the headphones and I tried them as well and I actually like them a lot better than my J Lab in ear headphones.,598
2953,"In addition, they are bulky and don't allow for leaning on anything.",598
2954,It is really a shame because the headphones are still good but I cannot use them any more.,598
2955,Honestly should have just bought another pair of 220's.,598
2956,"For example, if I put my phone in my front left pocket and walk then the connection has a tendency to break up in time to my steps.",598
2957,Headphones exceeded my expectations!!!!,598
2958,"I'm about to get another pair.....the other two grew legs

Very rugged (they last a long time), no shedding (some earphones do), and I really like the weight and size",598
2959,More comfortable than the 220.,598
2960,"Sounds like a $50 pair of headphones, not a $15...VERY worth it.",598
2961,I don't know why this product has so many good reviews.,598
2962,My happiness scale goes all the way up when I listen to music through these.,598
2963,"Overall, they were a great value, no complaints about the sound.",598
2964,These are keepers.,598
2965,"i wanna know if it's possible that if i send this back and they can give me a refund, or give me one that works.",598
2966,"I loved these white headphones, they are of good quality and portable.",598
2967,Head phones worked as advertised.,598
2968,Bluetooth range not great but not a detractor.,598
2969,The quality of sound for songs and movie is ok with me but I am not expert.,598
2970,"Sound is good (not Bose or anything, but I think it is pretty good for listening to Pandora and computer stuff), and they are super confortable.",598
2971,I think they look stylish...we'll see if they agree.,598
2972,It has been AGES since I ordered these and they still work!,598
2973,Great distance and battery life.,598
2974,"These headphone look stylish, contour to my head well, and sound great!!",598
2975,He loves them and we are extremely happy.,599
2976,Lastly I just want to say that these come with a nice sturdy cord.,599
2977,Sound quality is acceptable for avarage not demandable user.,599
2978,There are other Sennheiser options in the sub-20 dollar range that have much better sound than these.,599
2979,Great sound and hopefully durable for the long haul!,599
2980,"As for colors: I mainly don't care, but there is some small utility value in having different colors, to make it easier to keep track of which is charged or which belongs in my gymbag.",599
2981,"If its for regular use and just upgrading from stock headphones then go for it, but if your a audiophile and looking for some new bluetooth headphones skip these as you will be disappointed.",599
2982,I would even pay for it because without it they are useless.,599
2983,I thought I missed charging this completely.,599
2984,The build isn't the best.,599
2985,"Probably needless to say, the Bose OE2 lightweight headphones, also top rated by Consumer Reports, sound the best.",599
2986,Only foolish people with too much money pay more than this for headphones.,599
2987,"Being a rather critical music listener I bought five different sets of on-ear type headphones to choose among, comparing all of them with the equalizer set to flat across.",599
2988,My biggest complaint is that I can't lay down with them on as the headband runs across the back of the head and is very uncomfortable to lie/lay on.,599
2989,Could be me but I don't find myself to be technologically illiterate and I completed normal troubleshooting procedure.,599
2990,Other than that they are very good.,599
2991,I purchased these a year ago along with a portable DVD player for our car.,599
2992,"I don't know what people are talking about, those who rate it like 1 or 2 stars.",599
2993,"Able to use these with my computer, iPad, and iPhone, no issues.",599
2994,Would most definitely buy another pair of these!,599
2995,"they are bulky around the neck when not on your ears, which i do not constantly wear them, on the ears.",599
2996,"If you put these in a backpack or duffle, be extremely careful.",599
2997,I purchased the Artic P311 and Kinivo BTH204 together.,599
2998,These phones are used by a deaf friend of mine so he can listen to audio books.,599
2999,Very light and folds up for travel.,599
3000,I am a bigger guy with a larger head so the headset is a little tight around the back of my head.,600
3001,"It's also a fairly long cord, so I can just keep my MP3 player in a pocket on my shorts and it's long enough that it won't tug on my head .",600
3002,NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL and not adjustable.,600
3003,I have been using these for months at work everyday for 8 hours.,600
3004,The ONLY draw back to these headphones is that if you wear glasses (like I do) it takes some adjusting so that the ear handles of your glasses don't keep the headphones from sitting right...,600
3005,I bought 2 pairs of head phone for a long trip to Asia.,600
3006,They're better than the Skullcandy 2XL's that I was replacing like Pez ... when I can hear them.,600
3007,These came faster than expected!,600
3008,"couldn't stand it, so i stuffed toilet paper in a plastic bag and wrapped it all up in duct tape.",600
3009,"They sound fine, and work okay if I am sitting still..",600
3010,Now I just recieved the BTH240 and it is 2.1+EDR same as the older version.,600
3011,"For the price you cannot do any better on Amazon, believe me I've checked.",600
3012,"Alas, they did not.",600
3013,"The sound quality is fine, not amazing but it will do.",600
3014,I'm glad that I did.,600
3015,Sound is clear and loud.,600
3016,Perfect for me at work.,600
3017,"So all the similarities are there, someone said the size of these protruding are smaller than others but i found them to be the same.",600
3018,These were perfect for that purpose!,600
3019,They are fantastic!,600
3020,"Stylish, cheap, and sounds really good.",600
3021,The only issue I have ever had is after 5 years of continuous use and abuse the headband has become loose (grip wise) so when I bend down they have a tendency to start slipping off.,600
3022,They have a VERY CLEAR sound.,600
3023,Surprise--there are differences.,600
3024,I read some of the reviews about these headphones before buying them.,600
3025,I would have given 5 stars had the cable been longer.,601
3026,These headphones can get pretty loud too.,601
3027,"Not a big deal tough...

Worth the price, if you are looking for a cheap Bluetooth Headphone, this one is probably will fit your necessities.",601
3028,After receiving this product I discovered that it didn't live up to my expectations.,601
3029,I love their sound quality.,601
3030,I must say you can pay $20.00 more and get the bluetooth Nuclear A/V's off Amazon and be blown away by the sound quality.,601
3031,As far as I can tell awesome product.,601
3032,I do find these more comfortable for all day wear than every other pair of headphones that I've owned.,601
3033,I will not claim that these are the best headphones ever or underrated in any way because they don't have superb bass or tempo in comparison to the top brands of headphones.,601
3034,These are great.,601
3035,They deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum.,601
3036,These are also very sturdy.,601
3037,"Besides, they are comfortable to wear.",601
3038,"Before I bought these, I asked myself if these were really worth it, but it was worth it.",601
3039,It is perfect for taking outdoors.,601
3040,Build quality is decent.,601
3041,That's what the money buys and no more.,601
3042,"However, they are not comfortable for children or people who have slightly smaller heads.",601
3043,I love how these headphones make it so easy for me to listen to music or a show on my tablet while being able to move around freely.,601
3044,I haven't tested with any music loaded on my device but will certainly report back if I see any issues there.,601
3045,I don't have a little head either.,601
3046,My daughter is using them with her iPad and is very happy.,601
3047,Bought these for my son for Christmas.,601
3048,The headphones themselves are very light and very comfortable on my head but the bad noise coming from the left speaker is always there.,601
3049,Perfect for me at work.,601
3050,"You can bring these up to passable by boosting the treble, but if you're using a device that has no EQ control beyond bass boost they're going to sound very muffled

The insulating pads.",602
3051,One minor minor complaint for both models are the drivers for the bluetooth on computers needed to be updated for the headsets to work.,602
3052,It is very nice to be able to move around my work space without a cord tethering me to the computer.,602
3053,I am so glad I made this purchase!,602
3054,I didn't expect that it will come earlier than I expected.,602
3055,The cheap Sony brand works just fine.,602
3056,Bottom line: The sound is very clear and they are easy to use.,602
3057,I had two of these... one stopped working after two months and the other still works but the mic doesn't work.,602
3058,"Good range, good battery life, great price.",602
3059,"Amazing sound and good bass, but the headphones did not look good when you had them on.",602
3060,"For the price I would say these headphones are about what you should expect, but I would highly suggest putting in the extra 10 dollars or so for a higher quality pair.",602
3061,"The bass, treble both are excellent.",602
3062,Such a basic headset and the wire connections get loose?,602
3063,"So much that if I leave them on my ears for more than about 30-45 minutes, it starts to hurt.",602
3064,The only thing it's missing is bass but other than that the sound is clear.,602
3065,Well done Amazon/Sony.,602
3066,"I bought this obviously for 3 reasons: cheap price, positive average reviews, and the brand.",602
3067,Audio quality and clarity is much better than expected.,602
3068,Light an fit his little ears and head with no problem.,602
3069,The build isn't the best.,602
3070,This unit would be fine for somebody with a narrow head or a child but normal sized people should buy something else.,602
3071,They don't completely cover your ear but the sound quality is very well put together.,602
3072,"can't even return them they, as they are already out of the return policy.",602
3073,"After poking around the sound properties for this device, I found that it was set to Telephony quality sound format (single channel) with no option to upgrade it to CD or DVD quality (which I thought was pretty much the standard these days).",602
3074,She uses them with her iPod shuffle or watching movies on the computer.,602
3075,If you wear these headphones for to long they will make your ears red and sweaty plus really soar.,603
3076,(Very similar to the Dell version I bought about 5 years ago for $60.),603
3077,They exert some kind of pressure on my ears.,603
3078,Definitely a great buy!,603
3079,These probably aren't really good for music.,603
3080,*Bluetooth connectivity was a breeze (I have a Pantech Marauder android phone that found the head phones in 5 seconds).,603
3081,"And thats not even the loudest the headphones can go, I have not tried these at full volume, and I don't plan on it, I'd rather not blow the speakers.",603
3082,"It's not the most comfortable experience if you wear glasses, and it makes leaning your head back uncomfortable.",603
3083,I noticed when I put my hand over the side with the controls it really interferes with the connection.,603
3084,I purchased these expecting them to be comfortable and have better than normal sound.,603
3085,"For the price you're paying, you're probably not going to get much better quality than this, that said, there are a few issues, namely, no volume control on the headset itself, sometimes sound is a little weird til you tinker with the cord.",603
3086,"Very pleased, especially for the price.",603
3087,"Build quality is great cord length is actually perfect comfort is excellent, but the sound quality is most important.",603
3088,"Thought about Motorola, but went with Kinivo.",603
3089,The reviews seemed pretty good so I gave them a try.,603
3090,If you can find the right sized replacement.,603
3091,So they work best when you only pair them to one device and are very careful not to push the wrong buttons.,603
3092,"We don't use them everyday but for the occassional use, they are just great and the price is terrific - for the money, you we think you can't go wrong!",603
3093,I wanted to replace the USB Microsoft LifeChat I use with Bluetooth headphones.,603
3094,"In their backpacks to listen to music on the bus, at school for various classes, out of the backpack when they were home and countless times of falling asleep with them on, and rolling over onto them in their sleep.",603
3095,"The adapter is L shapped and bulky so if you have a case on your device (we are using a tablet), it is difficult to plug into it.",603
3096,I transcribe dictation at home and needed new headphones for my machine.,603
3097,"However, it does it's job quite well overall.",603
3098,"I purchased these headphones to use at our home computer for listening to videos, cds, and u-tube.",603
3099,He loves these headphones and takes them to the gym with him because he likes to listen to music or talk on the phone without having to worry about a cord.,603
3100,Great sound quality and able to move from room to room in house without loosing any sound (from end to end).,604
3101,Overall solid headphones nd great value for the price.,604
3102,"If you're really poor, hold out until there's a sale on better headphones.",604
3103,"I got two pairs, one for a friend in black and the white ones for me, he said that he really likes them because they sound very clear and have good bass.",604
3104,"can't even return them they, as they are already out of the return policy.",604
3105,And I that goes for the two pair that I bought so I know that it wasn't just a lemon that I got.,604
3106,I am very satisfied and encourage you to buy this headset.,604
3107,"When still, it works flawlessly.",604
3108,then you'll be fine.,604
3109,"Rather than sticking straight out of the laptop, this plug inserts into the laptop socket and lies along the edge of the laptop.",604
3110,I didn't think the fit was right for me.,604
3111,(they sounded a lot better) I went back online to find a pair of the rocketfish.,604
3112,The problem is they feel too small for my fat head and they are not adjustable.,604
3113,I used to be able to wear a hood with the V150s but the ZX100 are much wider and a hood just looks absurd pulled over them.,604
3114,Headphone is very lightweight and confortable.,604
3115,My son goes through headphones like crazy.,604
3116,"The sound quality is good even for on-the-ear style, so that is a redeeming quality.",604
3117,and I had it for a year now its been up with my nieces pulling and them sitting on top of them and I will say its put up with all that abuse lol.,604
3118,You can't beat these for the price.,604
3119,I think they're pretty good considering I only paid about $30 for them.,604
3120,These headphones have great sound and cost less.,604
3121,These are probably my biggest complaint with the device.,604
3122,Sound is clear and loud.,604
3123,"Also, the volume is great for me and it works well with my hearing aid.",604
3124,"I've purchased some other headphones in this price range that have served me well, but I don't think these would make it a week.",604
3125,The headphones fit comfortably and they are snug and do not move while running.,605
3126,It has been AGES since I ordered these and they still work!,605
3127,"This have good sound and okay bass,  they do need more treble but overall good product for the price.",605
3128,This allows me to hear my music clearly and spend less time adjusting the earbuds falling out of my ears.,605
3129,"They're great for that, and so much more.",605
3130,"The sound quality is good even for on-the-ear style, so that is a redeeming quality.",605
3131,"These are so comfortable that I can actually sleep in them all night if I want to, although they were not meant for that at all.",605
3132,"THE PAIR in question even with the mentioned issues, play perfectly fine out of both sides and still sound pretty damn good ...",605
3133,For $12 they are about all one could expect.,605
3134,I'd recommend these for anyone looking for a solid pair of bluetooth headphones thats always on the go.,605
3135,I used 22mm stuffed into each earpad.,605
3136,"These are very good headphones, overall.",605
3137,Because I really like the headphones a LOT!,605
3138,"Once your headphones and device are connected, they're basically ready.",605
3139,"The connector is 90 degrees, so if you're looking for a straight connector, this won't do.",605
3140,They fold up so nicely and fit in my bag to take anywhere I go.,605
3141,"The other set still function and work as expected, but extended high volume finally took its toll on the speakers.",605
3142,"Battery last all day, it's great!",605
3143,"The new Apple earbuds stay in my ears pretty well, but the wire is a hassle during a workout.",605
3144,"Very good quality, just the right amount of bass and does cancel out background noise pretty well.",605
3145,"Durable, great quality.",605
3146,"If you want better quality headphones, I would suggest investing into something better.",605
3147,I used these for about a month until the battery died.,605
3148,"I use it when I'm gaming, doing homework, watching a movie in the Library, basically all the time.",605
3149,If anyone would find these painful it would be me.,605
3150,SONY consistently delivers good quality.,606
3151,"I mainly use my headphones at the gym, watching videos on the elliptical machine and listening to music while working out.",606
3152,It keeps my ears warms as a plus.,606
3153,Excellent value for your dollar.,606
3154,"Overall, I can't complain whatsoever about the sound quality.",606
3155,I'm the type who I crank up my music and just dive into what I'm doing.,606
3156,They ended up being a little hard to hear since they don't block out background noise.,606
3157,These are perfect for my kids to use with the IPods or their boom boxes and using the computer to listen to music.,606
3158,The only difference I see is that the BTH240 uses the same size USB cord all of the cell phones in the house seem to use.,606
3159,Other than that they are very good.,606
3160,They fold up nicely.,606
3161,"I know most people are thinking ""why are you excited about something it's supposed to do"" but believe me, I've had many others that didn't.",606
3162,"I was going to send them back, but my husband (who does not have any type of TMJ or jaw ache issues) decided to keep them as jogging headphones.",606
3163,"(4) The head phone boasts connectivity to multiple devices at once, but never worked for me, tried using two mobile phones.",606
3164,"Sony did a great job on these...would buy another pair,for the price...you can't go wrong...",606
3165,Does not drop signal continuously.,606
3166,"The portion that wraps around your ear can get a little sore and annoying after a while, but just a little adjusting and it will go away.",606
3167,Amazing Headphone.,606
3168,"I have an older version of these headphones at home that still work well, but wanted another set for work.",606
3169,Use them to work out at the gym.,606
3170,of peace you get all day.,606
3171,We bought these for use on the computer with our 8 year old.,606
3172,"""It appears that you ordered a pair of Sony headphones for $15.86.",606
3173,"Overall, I'm a happy customer.",606
3174,These things are great.,606
3175,I haven't had them for long so I don't know how long there going to last.,607
3176,And my workouts are pretty long so I'm impressed.,607
3177,"For the price point, these are mediocre headphones.",607
3178,"When they arrived, with other things that I had ordered, the headphone package was open, the edges of it were all worn and torn.",607
3179,"Not as ""fancy"" as beats quality headphones, material is definitely on the cheaper side.",607
3180,The okay: I must have small ears.,607
3181,"Both our birthdays are coming next month so I thought I'd buy one, check it out and get another one if I like.",607
3182,"Fortunately, someone at Motorola must have foreseen this and engineered these rings that snap off of the earphone, allowing you to wrap the foam over them, and clip them right back on; amazingly increasing longevity.",607
3183,Bought two of them and they work great.,607
3184,(I must write at least two more words to meet length requirement.),607
3185,But I'll survive.,607
3186,Got the headphones for my son as throw aways because he is very hard on headsets.,607
3187,"Kinivo has it's game on, and they even sent me an email immediately asking if I received on time and how were they working.",607
3188,Great sound and hopefully durable for the long haul!,607
3189,Been wearing them since.,607
3190,They also have more volume than these kinda hollow tinny sounding ZX100s.,607
3191,"Easy to set up with Android Bluetooth, long battery life, fits well.",607
3192,"This meant that I couldn't hear very well because the sound wasn't actually directed into my ear, but more into the lobe region of my ear.",607
3193,The only thing I miss in these headphones is padding on top.,607
3194,"They're very comfortable, even after wearing them for extended periods of time.",607
3195,This is definitely worth your money,607
3196,"I revised my review to 4 stars, would be 5 if the microphone worked better.",607
3197,You can't beat these for the price.,607
3198,I was very impressed.,607
3199,cord is pretty thick for headphones in the price level and good strain relief near the ends that hopefully will give long and trouble free use.,607
3200,"I'm in no need of ""professional"" headphones.",608
3201,"Sound:
  Just bought a pair because I left my Alessandro MS-1s at home and am listenning now.",608
3202,"These are nice headphones, delivers in sound both bass and treble, works great with MP3 players (battery drainer) but sounds and looks great.",608
3203,"These ones lasted through running in snow, rain, heat.",608
3204,Keep looking guys & gals.,608
3205,"I had tried a couple other pair and always ran into the same problem, they were so uncomfortable that I couldn't wear them for more than 5 minutes without wanting to throw them across the room.",608
3206,At first was comfortable and snug on my head.,608
3207,I'm really happy with this product.,608
3208,"Deep, clear sound that you'd get from more expensive models.",608
3209,"So as long as you are not not using them in that situation, they work great and they are comfortable.",608
3210,I bought these after years of wanting a pair of Bluetooth headphones and I am glad I did.,608
3211,"The phones fold/flatten to a nice compact size, great for smaller bags.",608
3212,A co-worker had these and so I decided to give them a try.,608
3213,"If I'm wearing earrings, it's unbearable for even a minute, but even without, it feels very tight.",608
3214,I would personally recommend these headphones.,608
3215,"The pads were much bigger, and there was the padding at the top too.",608
3216,I purchased this for my wife for Christmas.,608
3217,"Given the price, this should be expected.",608
3218,They sat for another 6 months until I got around to fixing them.,608
3219,Great headphones for what I need them for and for the price.,608
3220,They sound significantly worse than the $20 store-bought Sony headphones I'd been using.,608
3221,They arrived quickly.,608
3222,"I have an above-average size head, I'm a husky 6'-2"", but come on, I'm no freak - the product should at least be adjustable to fit me.",608
3223,Hurt my head within 15 minutes.,608
3224,"If you have a big head, stay away, they will fall off.",608
3225,Sound is okay/cool and I love that the right side has a read mark so u can easily know what side to put where.,609
3226,";) I didn't want to spend a lot on headphones, but I also have some difficulty with headphones making my ears/head hurt (either by poor design or bad acoustics).",609
3227,First pair lasted 22 months with no issue.,609
3228,They just last song long.,609
3229,They also lay flay which is nice for travel.,609
3230,"If you really care about studio type clarity, you need to at least $100 to your budget price point and look elsewhere.",609
3231,I rarely use it.,609
3232,"- I don't care how cheap it is, if your product is not really noise canceling, do not advertise it as such.",609
3233,I can't believe the quality of it.,609
3234,Does not look genuine sony product.,609
3235,I use these for lectures and listening to music and it serves its purpose well.,609
3236,I do not recommend these headphones for anyone who has a large head.,609
3237,"For the price I would say these headphones are about what you should expect, but I would highly suggest putting in the extra 10 dollars or so for a higher quality pair.",609
3238,I feel like a little more width around back might help give a better angle that wouldn't pinch my ears.,609
3239,"Great sound quality, definitely 10/10
2.",609
3240,"The sound is not great, although not terrible either.",609
3241,"The company is not aiming to produce a pair of stellar-quality headphones at under $20, just a pair that will suffice for the average user.",609
3242,"I wanted a set that was comfortable, since they can be on for hours and also noise reduction.",609
3243,"When using to talk on a phone call, they have great clarity and work very well.",609
3244,"After all they've been through, they are still working in perfect condition.",609
3245,The midranges and the highs serve to add dimension and overall they are biased pretty well.,609
3246,"Bottom line was that they provided very good sound quality and fit well on everyone's head, from my giant noggin down to my then-preschooler.",609
3247,"I bought them for my son to use in school, but everyone (including my son) wants to use them at home.",609
3248,One of the speaker has stopped working and I can't use it any longer.,609
3249,It is very comfortable on the ear as well.,609
3250,"I had been searching for days upon days for a headphone, but being the penny pincher that I am I finally found these headphones.",610
3251,"Also the headband isn't padded, it's just plastic.",610
3252,I haven't tried it in a noise area for phone conversations.,610
3253,Able to block out my surroundings and the long wires make it easy for me to move around freely.,610
3254,"And it works perfectly with my android tablet, PC, and phone.",610
3255,This allows me to hear my music clearly and spend less time adjusting the earbuds falling out of my ears.,610
3256,All of that compared to same priced motorola device.,610
3257,"Up to now it works fine, no music ""skipped"" at all.",610
3258,Spend the extra 10-20 to get some sturdy headphones with padding.,610
3259,"At first I thought this was perhaps my wifi as I was streaming music, but subsequently I tried with music stored locally on my phone and had the same results, so it appears it is indeed the bluetooth connection.",610
3260,They fit well on the ears.,610
3261,Easy to pair with devices also.,610
3262,came securely and professionally packaged.,610
3263,"For its price, this delivers very good sound.",610
3264,Works great to talk through as well.,610
3265,"Given the price, this should be expected.",610
3266,Haven't had anyone complain that they can't hear me while talking to them on it.,610
3267,He has had no complaints!,610
3268,I am considering a second pair so I won't have to share.,610
3269,Talk about cool in a restaurant.,610
3270,Love how you can adjust for comfort.,610
3271,"One star less because it is not in same league as those top of the line headsets but as I said, super value for money.",610
3272,This is definitely worth your money,610
3273,Sony is a great brand got the white  color.,610
3274,These sound good and they don't distort when I set a high volume.,610
3275,"These head phones are good quality, you can hear clearly.",611

3278,Connection to my laptop was seamless.,611
3279,Purchased these based on other reviews three weeks ago.,611
3280,"I am not a professional dj, and nor is my daughter;)",611
3281,If it manages to stay connected audio becomes laughably out of sync.,611
3282,"I was able to put it back in and use it still, but it pops out still every now and again.",611
3283,"If you want to try Bluetooth headphones but don't want to spend a lot, these are for you.",611
3284,the sound quality seems good and the headphones have held up well to use.,611
3285,Super durable I guess.,611

3287,"So far, I don't have any complaints.",611
3288,"These are lightweight, don't crush my head, decent sound and the cord is just the right length.",611

3294,They bounce just slightly when on a run but will not fall off.,611
3295,They connect to all my devices.,611
3296,You won't find this quality for that cheap at your local Wal-Mart.,611
3297,"So far, I don't have any complaints.",611
3298,"It's been a while since I bought some over ear headphones... and let me say that I love headphones, and while I love my music, I wouldn't say that I could qualify as a true audiophile.",611
3299,For the price these are a great buy.,611
3300,The battery lasts about 10 hours listening to music.,612
3301,Also volume is good.,612

3304,"They are light, they work, they fit my head, they have decent sound quality.",612
3305,The sound quality is good.,612
3306,There are other Sennheiser options in the sub-20 dollar range that have much better sound than these.,612
3307,"I like the easy connectivity, but what they are lacking is different audio settings.",612
3308,"Oh, my previous 3 pairs that this beats:
Skullcandy Hesh
Skullcandy Inked
Panasonic RP-HTX7PP (Although very very very close.",612
3309,These probably aren't really good for music.,612
3310,**the instruction book that comes with the headset specifies the A2DP setting and once i figured out how to set that properly i've had no issues.,612
3311,"The white is nice and the red is a cute touch, I get a lot of compliments on these.",612
3312,"My first set was the BTH220, and I loved them so much I bought the 240.",612

3315,Fit is fair too.,612
3316,Both headphones are about the same sound wise.,612
3317,"So they are wireless and you can answer phone calls with them, what's better than that.",612
3318,"I wouldn't recommend them for hardcore music or gaming, but they're not really designed for that anyway.",612
3319,"If you consider the price, it can't be any better than this product.",612
3320,I've had these over a year I think and I have not experienced a short in either cord despite my 4 y.o.,612
3321,For the money you can't go wrong.,612
3322,but i figure thats a given with the behind the ear.,612
3323,I listen to the audio books from my IPhone and I Pad.,612
3324,"For the rest of us, these are okay.",612
3325,"We went through countless ear buds and headsets, most would last a week if we were lucky.",613

3327,She has multiple sclerosis and has no feeling in her arms and hands.,613

3329,I would say this is a very nice pair of headphones for the price you are paying for them.,613
3330,There is no clarity.,613
3331,"Note that these are the sports-type of headphones, and instead of going over the top of the head, they go behind the neck.",613
3332,I love the headphones.,613
3333,"Outside sounds, like sounds of shrieking children while you're wearing headphones, seemed to be amplified to a piercing sound to me.",613
3334,These are good for the price.,613
3335,It's comfortable.,613
3336,And it allows me to be able to speak to the little kids without trying to speak above the sounds from his math blasting out from the speakers!,613
3337,These are keepers.,613
3338,"I have bought many pairs of ear buds, all painful.",613
3339,"They look a lot cheaper than you'd expect, even though they're so cheap.",613
3340,Obviously the quality isn't great compared to high end models but for the price they are a great buy.,613
3341,If you are looking for a great house phone Panasonic makes one with Bluetooth so you can charge your Smartphone and still talk.,613
3342,I just didn't take it upon myself to actually see what that size would be.,613
3343,I was skeptical with what the quality would be like considering the low price.,613
3344,She would bang them on everything and drag them hanging from her tablet up the wood stairs everyday.,613
3345,*Update* I had to buy a new one at three and half years but I bought the same ones again because they pair so well and I had no issues with them.,613
3346,I let people listen and now 3 other people have bought them.,613
3347,They are great for running or other exercise.,613

3349,I am using these for watching movies.,613
3350,"There is some getting used to the controls- volume, pause, bluetooth, etc.",614
3351,"Now, on a regular basis, I use these headphones for just listening to music walking down the street from my ipod.",614
3352,I'd wonder if someone with normal or large ears might have some trouble with the size of the ear pieces.,614
3353,The 10-hour rating for battery life seems right.,614
3354,Battery life is awesome and last me at least 2 days with heavy use.,614
3355,The earpads rotate so it is more compact.,614
3356,I went straight the amazon webpage and found that the Kinivo BTH240 would be a good fit for him.,614
3357,"Use for exercise: Stays on while I am walking on a treadmill or elliptical, but not running.",614
3358,"For two days I kept rearranging them, thinking I had to be wearing them wrong, because no one would intentionally make headphones this uncomfortable.",614

3360,Very impressed with how long they can go without a charge.,614
3361,"2014 CHristo as my Grandma purchased these head phones for me, they were great till late November of this year.",614
3362,I guess you get what you pay for.,614
3363,Arrived earlier than expected.,614
3364,"Also, the sound was really poor.",614
3365,My kids love them.,614
3366,These are good for the price.,614
3367,Here's a hint: EQ them.,614
3368,Don't think it's possible to find anything better for this price.,614
3369,Sound quality is awesome it could be louder though.,614
3370,"unfortunately, they are a little too flimsy for my taste and it  took me a while to use them.",614

3372,I'm REALLY suprised by all the 1 and 2 star reviews.,614

3375,They continue to look nice after months of use and are easy to clean.,615
3376,They have good sound for just listening to music or movies.,615
3377,"The sound quality is decent, though not superb - I have Sony 7506 professionals to compare to for music, but they cost $100 so should be better.",615
3378,"after 1 hour of this thing, my head starts hurting cause the headband on top is made of hard plastic.",615
3379,Obviously the quality isn't great compared to high end models but for the price they are a great buy.,615
3380,"Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones.",615
3381,"Very clear sound, comfortable and light weight.",615

3383,There doesn't appear to be a problem with cable charging while in use.,615
3384,The jack is finicky and doesn't always connect to my computer right away.,615
3385,Best headphones I've ever had and so inexpensive.,615
3386,I wore these one day and did not know there was a car behind me.,615
3387,"Well, I think that because the headphone jack on my custom computer build is quite tight, it causes a spacer to break off.",615
3388,"i was discussed with the sound quality of these headphones, Sony dropped the ball on these.",615
3389,8.5/10 - Bass heavy and get uncomfortable,615
3390,"Good soun quality for simple video, music and talk hands free.",615
3391,So I rate 4 stars.,615
3392,"After I head some fancy beats snap, I turned to these.",615
3393,"They are a little bigger, but they fold up more easily and can be wound up and tossed in a bag.",615
3394,"I had tried a couple other pair and always ran into the same problem, they were so uncomfortable that I couldn't wear them for more than 5 minutes without wanting to throw them across the room.",615
3395,I would purchase these again.,615
3396,Excellent sound quality.,615
3397,"My PC with Windows 8, allows me to chose my default sound source, either computer speakers, or the Kinivo headset.",615
3398,"Overall very satisfied - it's also very cost efficient compared to its competitors, will keep updated as far as wear and tear.",615
3399,"However, if you want to use these headphones to eavesdrop on people, it's a five-star product.",615
3400,These aren't anything special.,616
3401,I was looking for decent over-the-ear headphones and found these on Amazon.,616
3402,"I purchased these headphones to use at our home computer for listening to videos, cds, and u-tube.",616
3403,Getting a second set for my daughter.,616

3405,I have purchased these headphones twice and I am 100 percent sure that I will not buy another pair of over the head headphones from another company.,616
3406,"After over two years they finally broke on me, one side stopped working.",616
3407,"Comfortable, great for bike riding, fits with helmet.",616
3408,"Most have written long reviews about Sonys cheap alternative, I am going to keep it short.",616
3409,I didn't realize how much I missed the bass that my earbuds didn't supply.,616
3410,I haven't had them for long so I don't know how long there going to last.,616
3411,Best investment ever!,616
3412,We already had red ones so we knew they were great headphones.,616
3413,Even though the functionally a good  the build quality is not sturdy.,616
3414,I have worn these on an airplane and could hardly hear the jets.,616
3415,Then let's talk about how they make your ears sweat alot!,616
3416,Wouldn't recommend to anyone hoping for quality with a low price tag.,616
3417,These have about half the distance before signal cuts out.,616
3418,I bought these for workouts but sadly they are way too bulky.,616
3419,Sound quality was moderate.,616
3420,"Paired quickly and stays connected consistently, with good range.",616
3421,"I mean, I am talking after a couple hours it starts getting a little annoying with the plastic pressing on the top of your head.",616
3422,The Panasonic RP-HT21 is head and shoulders above the Sony MDRZX100.,616
3423,"This is a wonderful product for me, as I where hearing aids and can't wear in-the-ear bluetooth.",616
3424,"You can use it on your Computer ""Mac or PC"" or on your cellphone.",616
3425,The sound comes out clearly and they stay on pretty well as i jog.,617
3426,I have no complaints about it and use it every day.,617
3427,Will keep searching for a better one to try.,617
3428,"I use them at work, at the gym.",617
3429,I am very satisfied for the quality of the headphones.,617

3434,Haven't had anyone complain that they can't hear me while talking to them on it.,617
3435,"Except that it's not for people with small head, it is a great product for casual listening",617
3436,"These headphones are not very good with music sources that don't have bass tone controls, -like your basic computer.",617
3437,"to make it even better the microphone is perfect, I took an audio clip with my iPhone's voice recorder and everything was completely clear (granted the house was quiet,) but I had no distortion or anything.",617
3438,Outstanding sound quality for the price and very comfortable to wear.,617
3439,I can't use earbuds and corded phones are such a nuisance.,617
3440,I will never ever order anything from you and I will advice everyone to stay away from your store.,617
3441,"So much that if I leave them on my ears for more than about 30-45 minutes, it starts to hurt.",617
3442,Only dislike is the way they hang on my ears and compete with my glasses.,617
3443,Might have been expecting a little too much from Sony for the cost.,617
3444,"Cons:
- not adjustable.",617
3445,They are the Best I've found for the price.,617
3446,I'm also a musician (bass) and  I think the music quality is very good.,617
3447,The battery life is out of this world.,617
3448,It also appears that the noise cancellation logic struggles when the input signal is low.,617
3449,"To me, the bass on these is perfect.",617
3450,I like how they came with a travel pouch/ bag.,618
3451,"The leatherette ear cushions also wore out after the first year and a half, but these headphones went through a little bit of a beating in their 2 year lifespan.",618
3452,"Fast forward to two years ago, and I pick up another pair of these, but in white, since the others had the rip and the white looked cool.",618
3453,"Good sound, comfortable and perfect for the gym or riding my bike.",618
3454,The headphones arrived quickly and worked well.,618
3455,My husband finally tested it and discovered that only the left side worked.,618
3456,It is a great set of headphones for the price.,618
3457,"I based my purchasing decisions largely on other reviews, which led to believe that the sound quality was better than it actually is..",618
3458,They also lay flay which is nice for travel.,618

3460,"These are listed for children, but fit my head perfectly, and the sound is great.",618
3461,Arrived very quickly.,618
3462,"I had to replace them, not because they stopped working, but because I broke them trying to remove the hard plastic bar that wraps around the back of the head.",618
3463,I can't believe the quality of it.,618
3464,They sound phenomenal.,618
3465,"Sony MDR-ZX100=sad, sloppy, muddy, and uncomfortable on the cartilage to boot.",618

3472,"I just received these in the mail a couple of days ago so I can't write about how long they last or anything like that, but I can say that I absolutely love them especially for the price.",618
3473,I found these particular headphones to be very uncomfortable.,618
3474,"If your going to buy these take care of them, if you don't then it will definitely break.",618
3475,"Purchased for my teenager who knew she wasn't going to get the $200 headphones, and she's very pleased with them.",619
3476,Update: The company contacted me.,619
3477,They are very nice.,619
3478,I also love the bluetooth - I feel so free.,619
3479,What you get are well constructed headphones with solid performance and very good Sony quality.,619
3480,I ordered another pair and they came right away.,619
3481,These phones are just great!,619
3482,They are reasonably light and nicely padded around the ears.,619
3483,Would definitely recommend them!,619
3484,I bought the headphone set for my granddaughter and she was ecstatic!,619
3485,"I mentioned that I used my TV - on the back it has a headphone out jack and I picked up a ""monoprice bluetooth splitter"" (those are your search words).",619
3486,I choose the Sony's because I have enough familiarity with Sony headphones to know that they are very clean.,619
3487,"It could have been a number of things, like my phone had too many apps on, Pandora lost connection or something, but I never experienced those problems while on a corded headset.",619
3488,"My only complaint is that they're described as ""noise cancelling"" and they definitely are not.",619
3489,"This is comfortable, sounds good and has a cord about 4 feet.",619
3490,"The range is good as well, compared to my previous headphones by Active.",619
3491,These give me the ability to move around and continue my life while she does that.,619
3492,"BTW, the 220's will still hold a charge perfectly.",619
3493,They are super comfortable.,619
3494,"Great sound quality, definitely 10/10
2.",619
3495,Thinkin about ordering another pair for home.,619
3496,Which is why the 4  stars instead of 5.,619
3497,I would not recommend this to a person who plans to wear headphones for more than 45mins per use.,619
3498,These are great head phones and don't cost a few hundred $$$..,619
3499,I'm a big guy with a big head and neck BUT I had hoped the designers had factored that into their design specs.,619
3500,It's too bad because they sound very good IMO.,620
3501,I broke the first pair in one ear because I pulled the cord hard so I got another pair and they are holding up well.,620
3502,The only complaint that I have is the headband isn't quite big enough for my head.,620
3503,They also work well for those long trips in the car when he would like to listen to his own music or watch a show on the DVD player.,620
3504,"As you can tell by looking at the photos, there is not any room between the plastic top of the headphones and the headphones themselves.",620
3505,"Perhaps it's because of the fit, though.",620
3506,These are my primary headphones doe.,620
3507,"Used them on my droid but can play them very lound for some reason, i believe it is my phone though.",620
3508,Took a couple times of listening to them to break in the sound quality but they are great for the price.,620
3509,I'm the type who I crank up my music and just dive into what I'm doing.,620
3510,"I've just been using them for a couple of days so far, but I am very pleased.",620
3511,Bought two of them and they work great.,620
3512,"From day 1 they were uncomfortable, but manageable and with decent sound.",620
3513,They where very comfortable and soft so I was very disappointed.,620
3514,The battery would not hold a charge after just 1 month of usage.,620
3515,"I ordered these headphones for my son, 17 years old, a wrestler.",620
3516,"Even though, it isn't better than beats they still make AWESOME headphones!!",620
3517,It is hard for them to keep ear buds in their ears.,620
3518,These could be really awesome but they just won't stay put.,620
3519,"And finally, a curious statement printed on the back of the package: ""If you use the headphones with WALKMAN that has a noise canceling function, the noise canceling function will not work.""",620
3520,"My sister bought these for me for Christmas, they were on my wishlist, regardless, they are awesome.",620
3521,I am happy with the purchase overall and would recommend them -- just to someone with a bigger head or bigger ears.,620
3522,This is my second pair the first worked great and I loved it.,620
3523,Great for the price and I will likely purchase them again when my son loses or breaks these.,620
3524,The sound quality is outstanding as well.,620
3525,The sound is muffled and sometimes distorts the low end if you're listening to a song with a lot of it.,621
3526,"I purchased these because I need something to speak with clients hands-free, in order to do interviews and take notes.",621
3527,The sound was better than the prvious model but they were a bit tighter of a fit.,621
3528,"Overall I give this product a huge thumbs up on price, sound, and durability!!!",621
3529,The wires are so tiny and thin that they easily get damaged.,621
3530,"Compared to the MDR-V100s that I was trying to replace after a speaker went out, this is complete garbage.",621
3531,I was skeptical getting these as I'm coming from having Rocket Fish bluetooth headphones.,621
3532,I had an employee there offer to actually let me try out a couple different pairs in the store before I purchased them.,621
3533,I specifically wanted pure white headphones (that one little red line doesn't bother me; it helps me distinguish right v. left ear),621
3534,This was a good buy.,621
3535,Lost them and re-ordered another.,621
3536,"So I can hear cars coming, but it doesn't interfere with my music.",621
3537,"The treble is generally a little low, but you can change your EQ settings and it'll be fine.",621
3538,"BTW, the 220's will still hold a charge perfectly.",621
3539,Not bad for the price.,621
3540,Work great for everyday use and the battery life seems good.,621
3541,"It remains to be seen how the collapsible neck piece stands up, but initial build quality seems good.",621
3542,"I actually bought a pair of these a year ago and have gotten a lot of use out of them-- I bring them to work in my bag and wear them on walks, to cut down on background noise, and for motivation boosts.",621
3543,So far (after 4 workouts) they have not let me down.,621
3544,As far as the Phone quality.,621
3545,"I bought this and the bth220 headphones and they have great sound quality and the first charge they lasted at least 16 hours, so with wear and tear over time I'm sure the 8 hour rating they give them will more than hold true.",621
3546,If you're looking for a pair of headphones as an audiophile I wouldn't recommend these.,621
3547,I don't use a $500 gold cable to connect my vacuum-tube amplifier to my acoustically isolated $10000 speakers.,621
3548,These went back.,621
3549,The only reason they get a 4 is because of the slight rattle of the buttons and time I had to spend getting them to my comfort level.,621
3550,Overall a good pair of headphones for a good price.,622
3551,I would recommend these to anyone looking for bluetooth headphones at a decent price.,622
3552,"My only complaint about these is that they emphasize bass a little too much, but they're definitely a solid option if you're looking for an inexpensive set of headphones for your office or when you're on the subway.",622
3553,"The ear pads are super soft, and if you're planning on leaving them on your desk all the time, they will be everything you need.",622
3554,"The cord is pretty nice, it is thick and sturdy.",622
3555,Mid range and bass sound flabby and out of shape causing the highs to sound choppy.,622
3556,"Although I received this item as ""refurbished"", it looks brand new and is in PERFECT working condition.",622
3557,It's actually big enough for regular people.,622
3558,Four stars includes value/affordability factors.,622
3559,And then last month another side of this product didn't fuction well.,622
3560,The build isn't the best.,622
3561,"I love the red thing that help you know where is the Right side of the Headphone, Very good sound for the price, few bass but is ok you are not paying much.",622
3562,I am using it with my nano touch.,622
3563,The headphones deliver good volume with decent fidelity -  perfect for watching movies.,622
3564,"Overall, good sound quality, good price, decently durable and comfortable to the ears.",622
3565,"But if you want to spend some where under $30, might want to give these a try.",622
3566,A really decent pair of headphones at a budget-minded price.,622
3567,crackles and bucks a bit.,622
3568,"Sometimes I will remove just one side so I can have a quick conversation with someone, letting the music continue rather than hitting pause.",622
3569,"These are simple, lightweight and sound good.",622
3570,I used at least 4 days a week.,622
3571,I will continue to use my $5 Koss headphones I got at Walmart.,622
3572,"They offer a lot of volume, great when walking, running, working around the house or mowing the yard.",622
3573,Well the headphones weren't picking up on the sound when I was using it with any program on the PC.,622
3574,"AFTER MY FIRST TRY I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM, THE SOUND IS LOUD AND DETAILED, THE BASS IS JUST RIGHT, NOT TOO MUCH TO THE POINT IT DISTORTS THE QUALITY OF SONGS.",622
3575,It gets the job done for the price one thing that is annoying is that you have to pair it every time you use it you can't just turn on your bluetooth and go like others after pairing it the first time,623
3576,"I'd rather pay more for better quality, but even the more expensive ones from Sony that are similar to this, have the same problems.",623
3577,(Did I even spell bear right?,623
3578,"Eventually, after falling to the ground and two years of general abuse they started to fail.",623
3579,I've bought some headphones that pressed against my ears too much and made me uncomfortable and some other headphones that couldn't take a beating and broke down too fast.,623
3580,I use it for running and walking.,623
3581,The product that came in the box looked alright but it was closed tight with just tape.,623
3582,Comfortable on my head.,623
3583,Getting another pair only because I can't find my first pair!,623
3584,I may need a little pocket charging unit on long outings.,623
3585,I was very surprised to experience the sound quality was just great.,623
3586,"If you're looking for a solid set of 'phones at a low price, you simply can't do better than this.",623
3587,Because the headphone is not adjustable to your head i try to put the plastic piece over my ears which hurts after a while.,623
3588,Happy with my purchase!,623
3589,Scares me real bad and is annoying.,623
3590,Down with Bluetooth.,623
3591,I can't understand how these are so highly rated.,623
3592,I have to turn off the bluetooth on my phone and then take unit off to shut down.,623
3593,Niceb Bluetooth headphones.,623
3594,Do not make the same mistake .,623
3595,"Plus, a friend of mine called while I was running so it had clear sound and she was able to hear me clearly.",623
3596,"The over the ear design works better than ear buds, which tend to fall out of their little ears.",623
3597,"I am writing this after a couple of years of ownership, and I haven't used them for a long time, but I dug them out and tried them again.",623
3598,Build quality is decent.,623
3599,Very disappointed of these headphones because it came out of the box playing out of only the right side... You may not get a defect like me but if you are unfortunate enough to get one then it's very inconvenient.,623
3600,Be mindful of this if you have a bigger head.,624
3601,The sound is good for the price and the wire is not flimsy.,624
3602,These phones are used by a deaf friend of mine so he can listen to audio books.,624
3603,Occasionally I unknowingly hit the button and start a phone call.,624
3604,Cheap and effective.,624
3605,"Occasionally there is an odd distortion when connected to my computer, but a quick disconnect and reconnect fixes it.",624
3606,I bought it for my granddaughter.,624
3607,"I'm not sure if they will be durable just thrown in a bag, I think I'll have to be careful with them...",624
3608,The only ones where 1. the don't hurt my ears 2.,624
3609,I find them very comfortable and the white on white color scheme is very sharp.,624
3610,Quality build you'd expect from Sony as well as quality sound.,624
3611,Tried another brand but they weren't as nice as these by a long shot.,624
3612,"These Sony headphones, while not fancy, certainly fit the bill.",624
3613,Now I am stuck with some useless headphones.,624
3614,I even got a hug 3 days ago from the 9 year old for buying them.,624
3615,I though it was kool that i was jamming out to Iheart radio at the gym the other day and my song pauses and i hear thing ringing and push the ear piece answer button on the side of the head phones and a super clear hands free phone call.,624
3616,"TIP:
If you want the ear pads to last longer, make sure you wipe the natural oils from your ears before using them - every time.",624
3617,I read some of the reviews about these headphones before buying them.,624
3618,Would most definitely buy another pair of these!,624
3619,It is very annoying.,624
3620,These are a great fit for my small head.,624
3621,It has very good bluetooth connectivity.,624
3622,"For the price, these are unbeatable.",624
3623,"Love that fact you can actually skip songs on itunes and Pandora, something units couldn't do a few years back.",624
3624,"Perhaps it's because of the fit, though.",624
3625,"My crazy suggestion would be to have some type of small mic that can drop down closer to the mouth if on a call, then just snap back up if not on a call.",625
3626,These headphones are the most uncomfortable I've ever owned.,625
3627,"They sound great, and function intuitively.",625
3628,"I received these on time and have only had them a few days, but they have worked great.",625
3629,"sound is OK. the best use is for working out at the gym, and you don't have to use the loaners they have there.",625
3630,The fit isn't quite as snug as I'd like and the headphones tend to move around slightly while jogging.,625
3631,They sound great and the Bluetooth connection rarely cuts out.,625
3632,"The sound quality is not breathtaking my any means, but I believe a very good value for the price.",625
3633,"I'm still on the fence on if I'll be trying another product from the company or not, because I really did feel it was an exceptional product for the price before the incident.",625
3634,Overalls great set if having chords is really not possible for you,625
3635,The sound is amazing and clear and they are extremely comfortable even after wearing them for hours.,625
3636,Used my 220s for over a year(8-10 hours a day) and they recently started having speaker issues so I upgraded to these.,625
3637,The headset works as advertised.,625
3638,And the finishing BEST feature of these is the price.,625
3639,"They Look great, feel great, and sound even better.",625
3640,Probably the 300 offers a better bass quality.,625
3641,I can hear if my phone rings :),625
3642,Sound is actually pretty good.,625
3643,these headphones have very good sound quality for the price.. they are comfortable and hardly weigh anything.. the white color stands out and it looks sweet.,625
3644,"Not noticeable at first, but you have to pay attention.",625
3645,I have been useing ear buds for so long I forgot how nice a set of headphones can be.,625
3646,The sound - is decent.,625
3647,Got for my boys for Christmas.,625
3648,Now the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone I have are worthless.,625
3649,I wouldn't even consider them as an upgrade from standard ipod earbud quality.,625
3650,I recommend highly that you buy a pair!,626
3651,"But as they are, I cannot recommend them.",626
3652,I have not had this frustrating experience with any other bluetooth headphones on the same devices.,626
3653,They got me on my feet when i first started recording music,626
3654,"That being said, I purchased these for my 14yr old son for Xmas for his mp3.",626
3655,The Sony head phones are amazing.,626
3656,I was looking for some inexpensive headphones that would give me good sound quality and this blew away my expectations!,626
3657,So I'll use them until they inevitably break...which they quickly will given the crappy cords they're equipped with...and then I'll go to Best Buy and purchase some more real ones at a higher price.,626
3658,"My son loves this product, and it helps us not have to listen to him playing his video games on his computer.",626
3659,I've looked up how to fix this online and tried other earbuds/headphones and they worked just fine on my computer.,626
3660,"Nothing fancy but for the price, what else do you need?",626
3661,"As of today July 9, 2016 they will not hold a charge.",626
3662,"It's also a fairly long cord, so I can just keep my MP3 player in a pocket on my shorts and it's long enough that it won't tug on my head .",626
3663,"Every time I turned on these headphones, it typically would take a couple seconds longer to sync up with my phone than other Bluetooth headphones I've used in the past.",626
3664,"The headphone is functioning properly,good sound,good mic reception, easy to configure.",626
3665,I use them everyday in the gym.,626
3666,"Also, these are not overly huge like other over ear headphones and since they cuff around your ears toward the back of your lower neck area, it doesn't get in the way of weight training.",626
3667,Quality build you'd expect from Sony as well as quality sound.,626
3668,This product delivers and so much more.,626
3669,Really only good thing about them is they hold charge very well.,626
3670,"They are very nice , lightweight, which is what I wanted.",626
3671,The 90 degree plug is bulky and  rather awkward.,626
3672,I have yet to run out of battery before a recharge.,626
3673,The sound quality is better than about 95% of the other headphones I've ever owned (all were wired).,626
3674,"He says they are
 fantastic.",626
3675,They are Perfect!,627
3676,I started my music player on my phone and the sound was great.,627
3677,Highly recommend.,627
3678,I have finally found a set of wireless headphones that stay on my ears without being too bulky.,627
3679,gonna order a couple more on payday,627
3680,The distance for these is good as well - I have yet to go past their reach.,627
3681,"I love all your other products, but these are big and bulky (I know, you can clearly tell that by the photo) and hurt the shell of my ears.",627
3682,They feel cheap but don't look it so I guess that is okay.,627
3683,It doesn't matter where - they are simply great!,627
3684,The only problem is they should use a better quality covering over the foam ear muffs.,627
3685,"Although the cord is a little shorter than I would like, it's still slightly longer than the cord on my Apple earbuds they replaced.",627
3686,I wouldn't waste my money on these due to the poor design.,627
3687,When I got them I fell in love with them.,627
3688,"My son likes them and orders the same ones, every time.",627
3689,"Sound quality is clear if you don't need any true base, but overall they feel very cheap for Sony Headphones.",627
3690,I also wanted to buy something very cheap so I don't need to worry about losing it or getting it stolen.,627
3691,"Deep, clear sound that you'd get from more expensive models.",627
3692,they still look great and put out a great level of sound.,627
3693,"A small thing, but worth noting?",627
3694,Highly recommend to those who have budget around 15-20 bucks.,627
3695,I find the slimmer BTH240 is more attractive and offers controls that are more user-friendly.,627
3696,"Theses were touted as noise-cancelling or noise reducing, but did neither - They also sound very thin with very little bass.",627
3697,"If you want a headset with with high bass, go for something else.",627
3698,The quality of the sound is very decent considering the low price point of these headphones.,627
3699,Shipped from amazon and got it the next morning (I'm a prime member so I don't know if it'll be that fast for everyone),627
3700,It is very comfortable on the ear as well.,628
3701,They go in the backpack with lunch box and everything else squished and squashed :-).,628
3702,I've looked up how to fix this online and tried other earbuds/headphones and they worked just fine on my computer.,628
3703,The other thing is to consider three taps to call as I double tap frequently switching songs and end up calling last number.,628
3704,In the past I' ve had to throw away more expensive headsets because it felt like my jaw was in a vice.,628
3705,I had the same problem as the first reviewer...won't hold a charge.,628
3706,The collapsible headphones make for easy storage but because of this the headphones are small on the head.,628
3707,Worth the money.,628
3708,I will just say you should probably get lil more expensive headphones,628
3709,"However they are definitely the best cheapest headphones I have ever used, and I will be buying the updated model from Sony.",628
3710,"So anyway the gadget is great, but I needed some headphones.",628
3711,"and as much as I love Amazon, I don't love over paying if I don't have too.",628
3712,The buttons on the side feel a little cheap but it's tolerable.,628
3713,I bought two for my kids.,628
3714,Getting another pair only because I can't find my first pair!,628
3715,I saw several people during my travels wearing these headphones so I would guess they are fairly popular.,628
3716,these are at a great price and work great i think i may buy another pair.. the only thing that takes a little getting use to is the behind the neck idea.. but other than that they have a great sound quality and an even greater price....,628
3717,I just picked up the SONY MDR-ZX100 headphones today and for the small amount I paid I can't believe the big sound I am getting with them.,628
3718,I would strongly recommend paying a little big extra to get quality headphones that you can actually enjoy.,628
3719,I used to be able to wear a hood with the V150s but the ZX100 are much wider and a hood just looks absurd pulled over them.,628
3720,"I had purchased a much more expensive, brand name set and found they hurt my ears.",628
3721,The fact that the ear pieces rotate so they can store flat is a great feature.,628
3722,"The sound quality is some of the best I have experienced with headphones under $20, you can get a fair bit of bass and easily enough volume to block out the noise around you without blowing out your ears.",628
3723,I bought some headphones thinking they had Base either than that there good headphones but no Base :( I would recommend this for who ever like headphones with Low Base :),628
3724,I've had these headphones for all of one day.,628
3725,"Obviously I can hear well enough or I would have replaced them, but still.",629
3726,These are my first ever Bluetooth headphones.,629
3727,"They might be good for children, or as a spare pair, but I wouldn't recommend them for your primary set of headphones.",629
3728,"Also for my MP3 player, like I said they do drain the batteries kinda fast.",629
3729,They work great for the children in eliminating background noises & listening to their teachers.,629
3730,These are great.,629
3731,"Honestly, spend a little more money and get a nicer pair of headphones.",629
3732,I have not had to charge them yet!,629
3733,I also wanted to buy something very cheap so I don't need to worry about losing it or getting it stolen.,629
3734,"Really comfort, may be too comfort.",629
3735,They will amaze you!,629
3736,These are good if you are looking for cheap headphones.,629
3737,It came on time as well.,629
3738,"To that end, I'll be trying the 66 Audio BTS+ next, to see if they're any better.",629
3739,I do find these more comfortable for all day wear than every other pair of headphones that I've owned.,629
3740,"My son likes them and orders the same ones, every time.",629
3741,I purchased these headphones after my daughter broke her pair on Christmas day.,629
3742,"These are really affordable headphones, nice and loud with decent bass.",629
3743,They felt very expensive on my ears!,629
3744,Battery life is awesome and last me at least 2 days with heavy use.,629
3745,I would NOT recommend these for purchase from anywhere.,629
3746,These headphones are hard to beat for the price.,629
3747,If you are looking for audiophile quality why are you buying $20 headphones??????????,629
3748,I switched to these after trying Bluetooth earbuds because the buds did not stay in my ears even with minimum activity.,629
3749,Scares me real bad and is annoying.,629
3750,"And they look nice with whatever I wear, plus when I want to not use them and wear them instead they're small enough to have around your neck without choking.",630
3751,"They fit her perfectly and they were what she wanted (over the ear, cutting out outside noise) with good sound.",630
3752,They are NOT noise cancelling by any means but it's definitely a bonus.,630
3753,"Though I am sure over time I may find complications and if I do I will update this; regardless I will still update this in 3 months, 6 months and a year.",630
3754,8.5/10 - Bass heavy and get uncomfortable,630
3755,The product that came in the box looked alright but it was closed tight with just tape.,630
3756,Earpieces fold flat for stowing in a backpack.,630
3757,Great phones!!!,630
3758,It cancels surrounding noise very well.,630
3759,These are great for any  music of mine!,630
3760,Mine lasts 1 year (I used it when running.,630
3761,"I don't personally have any complaints because for the price, they are very good sounding headphones.",630
3762,Great for wearing for long periods of time!,630
3763,Great little fella.,630
3764,I gave these 5-stars because they exceeded my expectations at any price.,630
3765,I am so happy with these and I sleep quite well.,630
3766,I was too lazy to return it which was my second mistake.,630
3767,Connected easy to 2 different phones.,630
3768,"The size of the speakers (the part that goes on your ear) is a little smaller than I anticipated, but they do tell you the size of the headphones before you buy.",630
3769,"Regardless, the headphones produce studio quality sound and even though they were white and used, there was not one indication as far as discoloration goes that they were used at all.",630
3770,"After reading good reviews, I settled on these and I'm glad I did.",630
3771,"The earlier pairs I had were decent, they'd last about 6 months then just stop working.",630
3772,My two boys ( teenagers) use them for school and for their music and there has been no complaint on the sound.,630
3773,These earphones are good but I wish they didn't feel so tight.,630
3774,Loose the wires!,630
3775,The Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone exceeded my expectations.,631
3776,I am considering a second pair so I won't have to share.,631
3777,Sony you should be ashamed!!!,631
3778,I wear them to the gym.,631
3779,It's no longer so white but that is expected.,631
3780,I was so excited to try these out considering all the positive reviews.,631
3781,These are fine.,631
3782,"I purchased a pair after being impressed by my fiance's, and when he lost his, he stole mine.",631
3783,They just recently died they no longer turn on.,631
3784,This product is replacing my previous 4 year old SteelSeries Siberia V2.,631
3785,"Disappointed, but somewhat satisfied.",631
3786,So far very happy with them.,631
3787,Hope you enjoy them as much as I do!,631
3788,This is my second set of these to keep separate places so I don't ever forget a pair.,631
3789,"I had been using a wired set, but let's face it, the wires are always getting tangled or caught on things.",631
3790,An hour or so and that's all I can take.,631
3791,The sound quality in these headphones is excellent.,631
3792,Cups/cans are too small to go around your ear.,631
3793,"-They stay on perfectly well while I exercise (workouts generally include lots of movement, and LOTS of sweat).",631
3794,The small carrying bag is a plus and thank you for including the USB charging cable.,631
3795,"I like the slim form factor, and voice prompts mean I don't have to speak ""beep beep"" to understand what my headset is telling me.",631
3796,"Sits comfortably over the ears, no problem using it continously for long hours.",631
3797,All of the New Music I just down loaded sounded greater than I ever expected.,631
3798,5) No clicking sound from the buttons as reported by other users.,631
3799,"Cons:
Don't get too loud
Bass is nothing compared to my cheaper, in-ear buds.",631
3800,These will be my second set of this model Sony headphone.,632
3801,I'm surprised at how clear and easy they are to use.,632
3802,Pretty decent sound quality.,632
3803,Phone calls can be a little on/off sometimes---callers can hear me perfectly fine but sometimes their phone calls get a little muffled.,632
3804,I bought and returned a number of headphones the past few weeks.,632
3805,I paired it with the TaoTronics TT-BA02 Wireless Portable Bluetooth Stereo Music Transmitter.,632
3806,"I felt they were very comfortable as well, lightweight etc.",632
3807,Now I still have to buy another headset.,632
3808,"Other than that, they're fine.",632
3809,I've had these over a year I think and I have not experienced a short in either cord despite my 4 y.o.,632
3810,"I bought two of them, one for each of my daughters.",632
3811,"The 240 has improved control options, but oddly less range for higher volume?",632
3812,"In fact, the performance is as good, or even better, than more expensive models under a 100 bucks (i had tested quite a few before buying these).",632
3813,They stick out a lot and make you look funny.,632
3814,Even just walking around the neighborhood is OK as they cut back on traffic noise.,632
3815,It's been 4 years since i've bought them and they are still going strong!,632
3816,"Sound is good :D
Although, the headphone jack made static-y sounds in the beginning when i moved it.",632
3817,"However both clips have broken and I've had to duct-tape them back into place -- next stop, Krazy Glue.",632
3818,I don't use a $500 gold cable to connect my vacuum-tube amplifier to my acoustically isolated $10000 speakers.,632
3819,They are NOT noise cancelling by any means but it's definitely a bonus.,632
3820,"Easy to use, light (in spite of their size), these headphones are really perfect.",632
3821,Both are built almost identical quality wise.,632
3822,"Smooth deep sounding bass, clear, crisp treble, almost no distortion at very high levels (not recommended).",632
3823,I don't wear it for long periods of time cause it get uncomfortable.,632
3824,"The fit is comfortable, the volume doesnt get as loud as you would like but for the price it was a good investment for bluetooth since I cant stand wired headphones.",632
3825,Bought them as gifts for directors who were competing at a marching band event and they loved them!!!,633
3826,This was even better then the original one I had .,633
3827,Kinova has a complete line of products and a site for browsing and support.,633
3828,"I guess I had higher expectations for these headphones, but a regular old pair of ear buds that you would think were lower quality lasted me longer.",633
3829,This is actually my second Sony MDRZX100 headphones.,633
3830,I was pleased that my headphones had arrived ahead of schedule.,633
3831,but on the good side it would match with your clothing quite nicely.,633
3832,"Don't drink and Drive unless your good at it, I used to be.",633
3833,"If you're looking for noise cancelling or higher sound quality, I would not recommend these.",633
3834,"Excellent head phones..In fact I still have them after 5 years,ear padding is a bit worn out but the sound is still so good..",633
3835,Pleased with the durability and reasonable price.,633
3836,I bought it for my granddaughter.,633
3837,"Overall, if the point is to listen to music, fine.",633
3838,"I don't ever review, but these headphones are worth it.",633
3839,But the Sont MDRZX100's have really good sound quality.,633
3840,"I like the slim form factor, and voice prompts mean I don't have to speak ""beep beep"" to understand what my headset is telling me.",633
3841,"Battery is a small 3.7v 400mAh rectangle battery, almost the same as the ones used in the small quadcopter drones.",633
3842,As a result music lacks clarity that you'll find in higher quality headphones.,633
3843,These earphones are good but I wish they didn't feel so tight.,633
3844,"This is less than that, do not buy these.",633
3845,"The arrangement with the microphone on the headset can work (on other brands), but it is not working well on this one.",633
3846,"Got these headphones based on a review in a magazine, and it was spot on.",633
3847,These sound really good.,633
3848,IF this is product is an indication they are back.,633
3849,"I bought these with a skeptical eye, being that I am familiar with Sony products, I was expecting good sound, but these headphones blew me away!",633
3850,This headphone meets my expectation for its price.,634
3851,"The size of the speakers (the part that goes on your ear) is a little smaller than I anticipated, but they do tell you the size of the headphones before you buy.",634
3852,I had hoped to use them on airline flights but the background noise made it too difficult for me to hear dialog.,634
3853,The greatest pair of cheap headphones.,634
3854,I can barely feel that they are even on my head.,634
3855,The cushioning around the ear is also very comfortable as well.,634
3856,They're super durable.,634
3857,"Cords are honestly the way to go, these cheap pos will only frustrate you.",634
3858,I would have given 5 stars had the cable been longer.,634
3859,- Playback controls on the right side for easy and convenient access.,634
3860,"Unfortunately, the left side of the headphones stopped working and has not worked since.",634
3861,I purchased these headphones for my mom to use with her iPad and she absolutely loves it.,634
3862,"2) The headband does not have any padding, and this caused a little bit of discomfort for me.",634
3863,They sound significantly worse than the $20 store-bought Sony headphones I'd been using.,634
3864,The biggest pro so far is that they are quite comfortable.,634
3865,These headphones do the trick.,634
3866,"I haven't tried thee with my iPod or any other devices, simply because I bought them for use with my Macbook .",634
3867,"One star less because it is not in same league as those top of the line headsets but as I said, super value for money.",634
3868,I have not got to the end of the battery yet and I pretty much use it all day long so it has great battery life.,634
3869,I would NOT recommend these for purchase from anywhere.,634
3870,i put these headphones through a lot of crap.,634
3871,It's no longer so white but that is expected.,634
3872,Small children I have.,634
3873,"After prolonged use and removing, my ears don't feel like I just came out of a compression chamber, and while my ears may feel warm, they aren't sweaty.",634
3874,"When you consider the cost for the Beats verses the cost for these headphones , it became an easy decision to make

I find these headphones to be more than I would have thought in regards to the sound quality.",634
3875,"The sound is great in these things and they're not very expensive, either.",635
3876,"That means the laptop is either on my coffee table, sofa, or my lap.",635
3877,I wish I would have spent a bit more money and purchased ones with oval ear cups instead.,635
3878,"In fact, a co-worker is so impressed as well that she is going to order a pair for herself!",635
3879,I recommend the vendor and the headphones.,635
3880,"I think either the technology is still evolving or better technology is still costly or else, speakers at this cost are meant to be this way.",635
3881,Highly recommend!,635
3882,The sound is good but the headband is so tight it gives my kids headaches.,635
3883,Extremely affordable for the average worker who just wants to listen to music at work or at home.,635
3884,"I am going to look into investing in another brand, ANY OTHER BRAND.",635
3885,I have no idea how but there is really no way to untwist it.,635
3886,"For the price I paid, I'm happy with the quality.",635
3887,It was simple to pair to my smartphone.,635
3888,These were a great fit.,635
3889,They are compact and lightweight.,635
3890,As far as the Phone quality.,635
3891,"Also, I wear hearing aids and these work fine with them.",635
3892,Works like it says it does.,635
3893,My head isn't too big.,635
3894,"But these are all small issues in my opinion, definitely not showstoppers.",635
3895,"They're not great for running with though, as they shift small amounts as you run making noise as the padding around the ears shifts.",635
3896,These got through 4-5 days before they needed to be charged.,635
3897,Decent earphones for a fair price.,635
3898,"I'm about to get another pair.....the other two grew legs

Very rugged (they last a long time), no shedding (some earphones do), and I really like the weight and size",635
3899,Hope this helps and shop smart.,635
3900,These headphones are great.,636
3901,I do recommend these headphones for general use.,636
3902,Very comfortable headphones.,636
3903,"I figured that if they were no good, I would lose only $15.",636
3904,I bought those back in May 2013 and am just now going to purchase a new set.,636
3905,I am using them with my Nexus 5 and Macbook to listen to music.,636
3906,I suspect that has more to do with Windows 8 being a terrible OS than anything else.,636
3907,ALSO it came in black-not white.,636
3908,Both sets died within a week of each other.,636
3909,I think it actually lasts longer too.,636
3910,Easy to pair with devices also.,636
3911,Used them for my workouts until one day (after a owning them only a month) they stopped holding a charge.,636
3912,Arrived earlier than expected.,636
3913,I use the pair they have at my office and after twenty minutes my ears hurt.,636
3914,"No, I don't have a huge head.",636
3915,i say get them in black because they can get dirty but easy to clean.,636
3916,"If you are a hi-fi head, you'll be disappointed with some of the range issues, but for the rest of us mere mortals, they are fantastic and give a true and clear sound.",636
3917,Used my 220s for over a year(8-10 hours a day) and they recently started having speaker issues so I upgraded to these.,636
3918,Then u have to keep wiggleing it to get it on both sides...  is any one else's like that?,636
3919,"these are nice, the bluetooth connection and not having to use a wire is nice, but these weren't loud enough for me, I used these in the gym the first day and it didn't block out all the gym noises like with my regular apple ear pods",636
3920,Finally figured out that they hook over your ears besides going behind your neck.,636
3921,I hated these headphones.,636
3922,I run treadmills and rid trains with this and can't care about anyone else's opinion about the brand because they don't know what perfection I'm listening to.,636
3923,I'm pretty sure its the connection between the wires and the 3.5 mm plug.,636
3924,If you just want to enjoy your music and want headphones that are durable get these instead.,636
3925,Really Love it Rather Spend 20$ for decent headphones like these than 200$ or more for beats!,637
3926,For the price worth the money.,637
3927,My head is not particular bigger the other people.,637
3928,Not a bad price either.,637
3929,"What's more, you can't watch video with them unless you're okay with the audio and video not being synchronized.",637
3930,I've never really counted how long the duration of a single charge is but I'd like to say around 8 hours!,637
3931,"I like the slim form factor, and voice prompts mean I don't have to speak ""beep beep"" to understand what my headset is telling me.",637
3932,I really wanted to get away from the wired ear buds I was using in the office as I would rip them out anytime I turned around.,637
3933,I wasn't expecting  the sound to be so crisp and clear.,637
3934,Very much worth the money.,637
3935,My kids love them.,637
3936,Would rather buy it for $10 instead of $15.,637
3937,"I find myself having to use the Small Speakers equalizer on my iPod to tame the treble, which I never have to do with MDR-V150s.",637
3938,"I don't know how they even justified the largest setting, as no one must have a head that large
-These are NOT circumaural.",637
3939,"Also, the sound was fine, but wasn't near the quality of my $30 Sony headphones that were wired.",637
3940,"Overall, I'm satisfied with them for the price they were.",637
3941,Definitely a good buy.,637
3942,Not perfect but what do you want for 30 bucks.,637
3943,"Once I hear that beep and plug them in for charging, it takes about 2 hours for a full charge.",637
3944,These headphones do the trick.,637
3945,They swivel so that it can lay 'flat' but do not 'fold' up into a tidy little bundle as do my Wonderful Air-Fi's (I'm spoiled).,637
3946,I hate them because they're not that strong and sometimes it only plays in one ear.,637
3947,"I have an above-average size head, I'm a husky 6'-2"", but come on, I'm no freak - the product should at least be adjustable to fit me.",637
3948,There's now a rubber cover on the micro USB jack; added protection from the elements and looks better.,637
3949,BTW its only day 1 so I will follow up with how they hold up in the long run.,637
3950,these headphones are great.,638
3951,of peace you get all day.,638
3952,The sound quality is much better than the ipad ear buds I had been using.,638
3953,If anyone knows where I can buy a cushion over the top of these please contact me chkaczsn@yahoo.com,638
3954,These are great quality for such a low price.,638
3955,These will be my second set of this model Sony headphone.,638
3956,They're the best ones I've ever owned.,638
3957,Then I accidentally snapped them in half lol because I thought they were fold able ( completely my fault; just know that they aren't fold able).,638
3958,"The sound is clear and of great quality, especially for the price!",638
3959,"Before I even downloaded all my songs to the new MP3 I purchased from Amazon at the same time as these groovy headphones, one of the earpieces fell into a vodker and soda...soaked to schmitt.",638
3960,I mention them only because they are on my wishlist.,638
3961,Pairing it to any bluetooth phone is easy.,638
3962,Just the quality Sony put into these $20 headphones!,638
3963,"In fact, a co-worker is so impressed as well that she is going to order a pair for herself!",638
3964,My head isn't too big.,638
3965,These give me the ability to move around and continue my life while she does that.,638
3966,"unfortunately, they are a little too flimsy for my taste and it  took me a while to use them.",638
3967,"Long range, good sound, decent battery.",638
3968,*Bluetooth connectivity was a breeze (I have a Pantech Marauder android phone that found the head phones in 5 seconds).,638
3969,"If activated once to open up voice calling on my smartphone it works wonderfully, but the headset refuses to perform the action again and provides a low-pitch beep that does little more than annoy.",638
3970,"Also, it seems like it struggles to keep pace intermittently.",638
3971,No bass to speak of.,638
3972,"I try 2wk s ago and love it but the draw back is the stereo sound quality, kind a not so loud to hear the music in a noisy work place.",638
3973,"For 20 bucks, they're more than worth it.",638
3974,These headphones have great style and sound.,638
3975,The wire is excellent.,639
3976,The only difference between these functions it how long the button is held or whether it is hit more than once.,639
3977,Wears comfortably for 4 hour long online classes.,639
3978,This is more subtle.,639
3979,"Having said all that, I blame myself, not the headphones.",639
3980,"Regardless, the headphones produce studio quality sound and even though they were white and used, there was not one indication as far as discoloration goes that they were used at all.",639
3981,Didn't stay on my head as well as I would like when weight lifting.,639
3982,I prefer my in-ear jawbones for outside of gym.,639
3983,but once i put them on i realized they had amazing quality.,639
3984,Love these Bluetooth Stereo Headphones.,639
3985,"Only good for small digital devices, which is why I bought them.",639
3986,It holds the charge the whole time I've used it too.,639
3987,This product is replacing my previous 4 year old SteelSeries Siberia V2.,639
3988,"Can't be beat for price and durability.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-MDRZX100-BLK-Outdoor-Headphones/dp/B004WODP20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony MDRZX100/BLK Outdoor Headphones</a>",639
3989,I plan on buying another pair soon.,639
3990,"From my wife's point of view, they are light weight, comfortable on her head, and sound very good.",639
3991,I had hoped to use them on airline flights but the background noise made it too difficult for me to hear dialog.,639
3992,Worked for about 5 months before dying.,639
3993,No bass to speak of.,639
3994,"the sound is ok, not bad but not great either, it is a little tinny sounding lack of fullness on the lower end.",639
3995,"The ones I had were actually Sony, and more expensive than these headphones!!!!",639
3996,They got me on my feet when i first started recording music,639
3997,After two days of having them the right side of the headphones stopped working.,639
3998,I also own the venerable V6's.,639
3999,"I'm considering the price range, I did not expect it to sound as good as a sennheiser but still it was a bit disappointing",639
0,"they do hurt my ears if i wear them for too long, but they are my first pair of over ear headphones, so i could be wearing them weirdly, idk lol",640
1,"You can pay a lot more but for a basic head set for your grand kids, this is the one.",640
2,"So far, the overall operations are working well and this is a very nice headset for the price.",640
3,Very good stereo sound.,640
4,Don't get me wrong I love this product and I went safe and purchased the product from amazon not a seller.,640
5,Overall it is a good product that I use on a daily basis!,640
6,"I'm going to  keep them because my ears are hurting too much from my earlier pair, and these $15 jobbers are very comfortable.",640
7,We are talking here about a $25 Headphone.,640
8,"edit:
the headphones only work on 1 ear now.",640
9,They look like they belong with the iphone super good looking and solid Sony quality.,640
10,(The working part of the aids are outside the ear.),640
11,"if you listen to music all the time, it may disappoint you.",640
12,"Again, they're pretty cheap material, but they can hold their own.",640
13,Even after sweat they work great.,640
14,But the Sont MDRZX100's have really good sound quality.,640
15,My mothers pair have stopped working after about a year.,640
16,"The sound is pretty good and when I use it to make calls, I've had no complaints about the microphone quality.",640
17,"A good fit over the ear is also a bit difficult to achieve if you have a smaller head, and I suspect if you had a larger head as well.",640
18,"At first, because these headphones are a little bulky, they got in the way somewhat and caused my earlobs to hurt when using them for an extended period of time.",640
19,This is whayy better than the bluetooth devices that you simply plug into your ear.,640
20,Calling them something you would give to someone you don't see often.,640
21,"Pros: comfortable fit, relatively lightweight for being larger headphones, great sound quality, easy to wear and easy to use; noise canceling ""enough"" for the price!",640
22,It is very annoying to get rapped in the cord when you are trying to run so I bought these.,640
23,LIGHT TO HOLD AS WELL.,640
24,"I like this style of headphones for running as opposed to earphones, because the earphones fall out when I start running at higher speeds.",640
25,Apparently the honeymoon is over.,641
26,"When I first put them on I had concerns about comfort, but they are quite comfortable for extended wear.",641
27,They sit comfortably on your head & ears.,641
28,Will people find something about them to complain about...Yes.,641
29,These came to me broken and I think that stands as a testament to the poor build quality on these headphones.,641
30,They deliver very good sound with this receiver.,641
31,"So I suppose I need to order another one, if I can find a color other than blue, red or black that's not hot pink (not my choice of a color, thanks!)",641
32,"It should be noted that they can be had from Best Buy for $20 with free shipping, rather than the $40 amazon is at right now.",641
33,The sound is good as well.,641
34,Range a little challenging sometimes.,641
35,The white makes them fun too.,641
36,"I might have gotten a defective one - my last pair lasted MUCH longer - but even so, very disappointed.",641
37,"To that end, I'll be trying the 66 Audio BTS+ next, to see if they're any better.",641
38,The cord is also nice and thick not thin and cheesy.,641
39,"I might have gotten a defective one - my last pair lasted MUCH longer - but even so, very disappointed.",641
40,I love these headphones.,641
41,Other than that one small thing so far all is great they wear good and sound good!,641
42,"They also cancel other sound remarkable well, almost dangerously so if they were worn outside running!",641
43,They simply hurt my ears after short periods of time.,641
44,"For use with my IPad, the volume is a little low even at the max when watching Netflix.",641
45,2) The rubber door that covers the USB port is flimsy and fragile and won't stay closed.,641
46,The backbone of the headset rests behind your head on your neck.,641
47,You should be fine if you're only going to do light use.,641
48,Loud if you want them to be.,641
49,"Then one day when I was trying to charge it, the red light turned on for 30 seconds or so and turned off right away.",641
50,The play time has been good and about 8 hours on one charge.,642
51,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,642
52,"As for the cups themselves, they have a nice cushion.",642
53,"So... my current earbuds NOW are a pair of Sharp earbuds, that came with an old cell phone, and are intended for phone use.",642
54,I suspect that my product was just an outlier but beware of the possibility.,642
55,Highly recommend this product.,642
56,Higher quality and a higher price to match.,642
57,My first set got me through most of a three-year stint at college before my continued abuse of the wires finally shorted out one ear.,642
58,Very decent headphones to walk around with and Enjoy your music .,642
59,"The wires that lead to the ear plugs create noise when you are walking, I had to rap the cords around the backs of my ears to get it to stop.",642
60,This is my second set of these to keep separate places so I don't ever forget a pair.,642
61,im going to keep these until i decide if i want to get better ones!,642
62,"For the price, Yeh they're worth $15 but not much more.",642
63,i say get them in black because they can get dirty but easy to clean.,642
64,The short synopsis is these items work fantastic!!!,642
65,"I used to borrow the school's headphones, but I didn't like the idea of using something that hundreds of other students were using.",642
66,"Some of the button functions, such as play/pause, are not instantaneous.",642
67,"I'm pleased with the battery life, and charging them up is simple with any standard micro-USB charger.",642
68,Down with Bluetooth.,642
69,For headphones made by Sony this is a great deal.,642
70,I mostly wear these for work sitting at a desk and listening to audiobooks.,642
71,"I might have gotten a defective one - my last pair lasted MUCH longer - but even so, very disappointed.",642
72,Even Sony considers the mdr v150's to be in the caliber of their professional studio headphones.,642
73,It also costed like 26 bucks.,642
74,"Plus, if I lost it, I could find it by outputting music to it.",642
75,The Mopw set worked well but was not a great fit (secure wise) but was broken in half when someone moved the couch back up against the computer table.,643
76,I love sony headphones I have the white pair and I have the black pair now.,643
77,They work great for the children in eliminating background noises & listening to their teachers.,643
78,This is actually my second Sony MDRZX100 headphones.,643
79,They are fantastic!,643
80,I've also put it in many bags when traveling where I'm sure the cords were angled in a way that should have caused fraying but the cords are fine.,643
81,I recieved the headphones very quickly...,643
82,These headphones are great for my daily walks...they also keep my ears warm in the winter...I live in frigid MN!,643
83,This is my third pair and I absolutely love them.,643
84,Getting a second set for my daughter.,643
85,The sound is spectacular!,643
86,Still worth the price though!,643
87,They stay in place while doing any excersise from pullups to situps.,643
88,Some final tidbits for those who care about these things.,643
89,They are exactly what I wanted I got them for my husband for Christmas and he loves he works in a factory with loud machines all around him and with these the noise is not a problem all He  could hear is  his music,643
90,The only reason I didn't give it four stars was the occasional cracking noise that I would hear when moving to a distant area from the Bluetooth device but that seems common in any Bluetooth device.,643
91,I went back to using my $20 wired headphones.,643
92,I have a feeling I could slice open the cable and find a loose connection somewhere.,643
93,This is my 2nd pair of BTH240 headphones.,643
94,"They don't like the earbuds and all the other (besides ""BEATS"") headphones kept falling apart.",643
95,He listens to a lot of classic rock so the 1st song he listened to was Kashmir by Led Zeppelin and he said it sounded phenomenal!,643
96,"- Portability, the BTH240's fold up nicely and slip into the included cloth bag easily.",643
97,"So, if you need a pair of ""Headphones"" but you ""Ain't got a lot of money"", then check these out!!",643
98,The chord isn't even compromised.,643
99,"Everything else is great, pairs easily, buttons work well, functions as advertised.",643
100,i complain alot about how the headphones i buy are too cheap and don't really work.,644
101,"Clear sound, no punching bass like the XB series but still good enough to sound good on a rap track.",644
102,This set delivers in all aspects and lets me listen to my music without the whole house having to listen to it as well.,644
103,I gave this a 4 star because when walking outside I sometimes lose the connection.,644
104,"The good, the bad, and the ugly:
Good- great ergonomic design, very nice feeling on the ears.",644
105,They deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum.,644
106,Paired right away with no issues.,644
107,We got these headphones for our hard-of-hearing members of the congregation.,644
108,I bought two sets of these for my children (ages 4 and 6) to use on an airplane with their kindles.,644
109,In conclusion great headphones for 15 bucks,644
110,I purchased these based on the reviews but ended up very disappointed and returned them.,644
111,I do wear glasses but have had no problem with other headphones.,644
112,The fit of the headphones is fine.,644
113,"Out of the box, quick connection to the phone and up for HOURS of great music.",644
114,they make my head look rounder because they are a bit wide but the sound quality is great!,644
115,"the tension of the headphones cannot be adjusted, only the length can be adjusted.",644
116,Connected to ASUS PC via Polk Radio amplifier.,644
117,"The wires that lead to the ear plugs create noise when you are walking, I had to rap the cords around the backs of my ears to get it to stop.",644
118,These came faster than expected!,644
119,They sound ok - especially after the in ear wired set I was using started to drive me crazy.,644
120,"Only three stars because these feel even cheaper, and fit worse than a pair I received for free for promotional purposes, with a hospital's name on them.",644
121,"not much power under the hood coming from an ipod touch 4, and it isn't comfortable like anything you spend big bucks for.",644
122,"Most importantly, the Kinivo earphones are comfortable for me while exercising.",644
123,She says they work great and she loves the quality of the sound.,644
124,"If you are looking for reasonably priced good quality sound, buy these.",644
125,Over the ear without encasing my whole head and heating me up.,645
126,I recommend the vendor and the headphones.,645
127,The Motorola's being to hurt the insides of my ears after extended wear.,645
128,"But as they are, I cannot recommend them.",645
129,"I would look for a more comfy band in this headphone series, if that exists.",645
130,"The ear pads are super soft, and if you're planning on leaving them on your desk all the time, they will be everything you need.",645
131,"They are small, so the sound quality is not what you would get with a good pair of speakers or headphones and fall out of your ears.",645
132,"(If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking ""yes"" at the end of my review!)",645
133,Good for working out and casual listening.,645
134,You should be fine if you're only going to do light use.,645
135,I love using these when I work out since it allows me to answer phone calls.,645
136,I don't know why but I love them!,645
137,They have met all my expectations...,645
138,So let's just say they could be more comfortable when your head is lying on a pillow.,645
139,"I used them for several hours every day, and only charge them up once a week.",645
140,"For the price you're paying, you're probably not going to get much better quality than this, that said, there are a few issues, namely, no volume control on the headset itself, sometimes sound is a little weird til you tinker with the cord.",645
141,"Their fashionable as well the finish to the headphones are great, as well as being really comfortable and sturdy- you get the feeling that these aren't going to break.",645
142,Being able to hear in both ears is a great experience.,645
143,"Call quality is solid, and being able to walk around the office while on a call is wonderful.",645
144,But the best thing of all is the price - $25!,645
145,Both are built almost identical quality wise.,645
146,But the effort is worth it with the Kinivo 240s.,645
147,Lastly I just want to say that these come with a nice sturdy cord.,645
148,Both are built almost identical quality wise.,645
149,"Rather sturdy, feels like it won't break too easily, I'll let you know how that goes.",645
150,I would definitely go with these headphones,646
151,First pair lasted 22 months with no issue.,646
152,"The cord is pretty nice, it is thick and sturdy.",646
153,There is no clarity.,646
154,"I got a call while running the other day and I had no trouble picking it up, I heard them clearly and they could hear me as well.",646
155,"Also, I wear hearing aids and these work fine with them.",646
156,Decent earphones for a fair price.,646
157,I did think that the range would be better.,646
158,I used these mainly for going to the gym.,646
159,Took a couple times of listening to them to break in the sound quality but they are great for the price.,646
160,"Would certainly buy from them again, hopefully these hold up to the daily use while hubby works out",646
161,"The first set I use with my computer in the office, the second I use with my tablet at home so I can watch Netflix while my wife is watching television.",646
162,It's a little annoying.,646
163,The only gripe would be the band is stiff and really really wide.,646
164,Wish they fit a bit tighter though.,646
165,"I haven't had mine for very long and they seem to be made of cheap plastic, but Sony products tend to last a long time, so I'm not sure about the life span of these.",646
166,"My complaints are mostly about how they are built:  The cord is extremely short, even shorter than the MDR-V150, and it's taking some getting used to.",646
167,Hope this helps and shop smart.,646
168,I paid 29.99 for mine and I can't find anything wrong with them.,646
169,For the price paid these are decent headphones.,646
170,I may need a little pocket charging unit on long outings.,646
171,It's a little annoying.,646
172,Would buy again.,646
173,"I had been searching for days upon days for a headphone, but being the penny pincher that I am I finally found these headphones.",646
174,"6) can pair them to my phone, and my laptop.",646
175,"And they look nice with whatever I wear, plus when I want to not use them and wear them instead they're small enough to have around your neck without choking.",647
176,"Cons:
1. when walking the outside noise can be loader than the headset.",647
177,The small carrying bag is a plus and thank you for including the USB charging cable.,647
178,I purchased a headset before these for 11 dollars and the connection on those were beyond better than the kinivo set.,647
179,These are good if you are looking for cheap headphones.,647
180,"Excellent head phones..In fact I still have them after 5 years,ear padding is a bit worn out but the sound is still so good..",647
181,"if i had to choose the price, i would price it at $34.99.",647
182,use them every day.,647
183,"Easy to set up with Android Bluetooth, long battery life, fits well.",647
184,They stay on well even with the sweat and the sound is decent considering the price point of 25.00 I ordered another set for my partner who spends a lot of time doing yard work.,647
185,Good quality earphones.,647
186,Controls are easily accessible.,647
187,"They made it all the way to Friday afternoon again... My previous headphones would last two days and crashed & burned permanently after a hard workout...
Definitely will buy again if the ones I have ever fail!!",647
188,"I actually bought a pair of these a year ago and have gotten a lot of use out of them-- I bring them to work in my bag and wear them on walks, to cut down on background noise, and for motivation boosts.",647
189,Which is why the 4  stars instead of 5.,647
190,"Decent pair of headphones, especially when you consider the price.",647
191,Easily paired to my android phone and stays in place while I workout.,647
192,This is definitely worth your money,647
193,"They are light and comfortable to wear, even while wearing glasses, and the pause, track-skip, volume, and phone functions work well.",647
194,I sweat too dam much and these have held up pretty good.,647
195,The problem is they feel too small for my fat head and they are not adjustable.,647
196,"Deep, clear sound that you'd get from more expensive models.",647
197,"Sound is good :D
Although, the headphone jack made static-y sounds in the beginning when i moved it.",647
198,They also work well for those long trips in the car when he would like to listen to his own music or watch a show on the DVD player.,647
199,"The headphones are light, featuring a nice, thick cable.",647
200,"For the price, the headphones are awesome!",648
201,"If you live by yourself or will be using these in a quiet room, they should be fine.",648
202,"The sound is crisp, bass is not drowning and it doesnt have hollow sound where voice and music sound separated.",648
203,It came on time as well.,648
204,It doesn't matter where - they are simply great!,648
205,"For the price I paid, I'm happy with the quality.",648
206,I've been through a few head phones so I was something of a skeptic.,648
207,"The sound on these are better than Apple headphones, I can assure you of that.",648
208,I bought this pair to replace my Sony MDR-V150 headphones which have deteriorating ear pads.,648
209,"These headphones are Better Sounding, (better balance; highs are crisper/less muted), Better Quality, Better Fitting, Pair Easier, oh, and are HALF what I paid for Rocketfish...  Major Home Run!",648
210,But it fits on the ears in such a way that it hurts the ears after listening for a while; say 30min.,648
211,"Wow, as another reviewer described, these are very uncomfortable, at least on my ears.",648
212,"So, I purchased these headphones 18 months ago and I honestly was happy with them at first.",648
213,Highly recommend.,648
214,A nice purchase.,648
215,I wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid.,648
216,I mostly wear these for work sitting at a desk and listening to audiobooks.,648
217,Battery life is awesome and last me at least 2 days with heavy use.,648
218,"Battery is a small 3.7v 400mAh rectangle battery, almost the same as the ones used in the small quadcopter drones.",648
219,If that is the purpose it is,648
220,I read a bunch of reviews on the headphones and decided to give it a try.they work so well and cancel out noise unless you take it off.,648
221,Then u have to keep wiggleing it to get it on both sides...  is any one else's like that?,648
222,"These ones lasted through running in snow, rain, heat.",648
223,Though not flush it fits your ear well and is not loose.,648
224,"I have only had the headphones for a day, but I am impressed.",648
225,"Anyway, with all the other headphones at the same price range that exist out there, I just returned them and bought something else.",649
226,"Even when I'm not trying to fiddle with them, my left ear canal is slightly bigger than my right and almost all ear buds end up sliding out or moving out of place, even with earhooks.",649
227,"Also, I wear hearing aids and these work fine with them.",649
228,They really work.,649
229,"The sound on these are better than Apple headphones, I can assure you of that.",649
230,I thought I missed charging this completely.,649
231,I have to reconnect it at least 10 times a day.,649
232,I BOUGHT A 2ND SET FOR MY WIFE TO PRACTICE HER GUITAR THRU A SMALL AMP AND SHE LOVES THEM AS WELL.,649
233,The small carrying bag is a plus and thank you for including the USB charging cable.,649
234,I can tell I have a headset on when talking to others but they all say they cant tell one bit that I was on my headset!,649
235,You can wear them for a long time without getting a headache (also note that I have a big head and a lot of hair so this tends to be a problem for me).,649
236,"The plastic is just porous enough to take to sharpies, paint markers, and stickers, so you can customize them to your heart's content.",649
237,"I'm a trained audio engineer, but I get that these are cheap-o headphones.",649
238,I also have had and used similar type headsets like the Rocketfish RF-MAB2.,649
239,"Battery last for months with a single charge (I use five to six times a week during one hour) Regarding connectivity is very easy to pair and once paired, it connects very easy to my iphone with a single touch.",649
240,The Sony MDRZX100/BLK Headphones work and sound great.,649
241,"They are very easy to use, and very easy to pair with devices.",649
242,I like the state as arrival at their destination.,649
243,They work pretty good.,649
244,Great sound quality and able to move from room to room in house without loosing any sound (from end to end).,649
245,I also like how the ear piece swivels to make a much more comfortable fit.,649
246,They also work well for those long trips in the car when he would like to listen to his own music or watch a show on the DVD player.,649
247,"However, under Ubuntu the microphone does not work, even when HSP profile is selected.",649
248,I bought those back in May 2013 and am just now going to purchase a new set.,649
249,"It's been a while since I bought some over ear headphones... and let me say that I love headphones, and while I love my music, I wouldn't say that I could qualify as a true audiophile.",649
250,Because the top part of the ear is in between the ear piece and the part that goes behind the head.,650
251,"I got these a long time ago, like years!",650
252,I have enjoyed them while listening to hours of Pandora at my desk without any notice of inferior sound quality.,650
253,Took a couple times of listening to them to break in the sound quality but they are great for the price.,650
254,"I'm sure they'll be put to good use, but if you get too rowdy @ the ""Ponder the Mystery Party"", Baby these  are comin' out!",650
255,"The over the ear design works better than ear buds, which tend to fall out of their little ears.",650
256,"i also haven't been very gentle with them, so i tend to take them off by sliding them off one ear and kinda yanking them off the other in one swift motion...and the frame hasn't twisted or bent in any way.",650
257,guess i'll be returning these Sony ones and forking up the extra $30 bucks for another pair of Sennheisers.,650
258,The first generation headphones worked amazing for almost 18 months before the power port rusted out from sweat.,650
259,I do recommend this product if you just need some basic bluetooth head gear.,650
260,"I got a call while running the other day and I had no trouble picking it up, I heard them clearly and they could hear me as well.",650
261,I let a friend borrow those so decided to get a second pair.,650
262,"For this reason, I will eventually be buying new headphones... at least these were cheap.",650
263,The only negative thing I can say about the headphones at this time has to do with the rubber piece covering the charging plug.,650
264,Battery last a lot too!,650
265,"I bought them to replace my regular earphones, and my first impression was that they are really good.",650
266,I told everyone I know about this product.,650
267,These headphones are just whatever.,650
268,For a great price!,650
269,"For those of you don't need the volume up quite as high like for walking or watching a dvd in a car, etc.",650
270,Very inconvenient.,650
271,"Even though they wrap around the back of the head, they still stay on through my routine.",650
272,I'm a teacher at a small alternative high school with students who have major behavioral issues.,650
273,"I would suggest buying these first, they're great for classical music, rock, and metal.",650
274,Overall decent for the price and for the style which seems to be somewhat rare.,650
275,"I've used the headsets for two straight business days running for 10 hrs straight on both days before I had to recharge the headset, that is excellent.",651
276,"Pros:
Stylish look
Comfortable to wear
Deliver's satisfactory sound quality.",651
277,Overall I wouldnt recommend this product and wish I had bought something else.,651
278,These look odd on me so I wear mine alone.,651
279,"When my old headphones broke, I did some research on Amazon to try and find a good replacement with a reasonable price tag.",651
280,"when they arrived, at first look I was worried about the non-adjustability of these because,as a female, my head is kinda small, but they fit OK.",651
281,"After a lot of comparison and online soul searching, Kinivo was my choice, as far as price, sound, and comfort it gets 5 stars.",651
282,"Overall, they aren't my favorite headphones, but they definitely do the job.",651
283,"If star ratings were correlated with price, this would be 5 stars.",651
284,"Perhaps it's because of the fit, though.",651
285,Will people find something about them to complain about...Yes.,651
286,"Everything breaks form Sony these days, including headphones.",651
287,The only thing I miss in these headphones is padding on top.,651
288,Can't beat the price and quality!,651
289,Until one side of the headphones stopped working.,651
290,These headphones are fine for a normal sized person like my little wifey.,651
291,I haven't tested with any music loaded on my device but will certainly report back if I see any issues there.,651
292,"Overall, I would recommend these to anyone and if these ever break, I will be back for another pair.",651
293,They produce crisp high's and nice bass with balanced midrange.,651
294,Fantastic sound!,651
295,Definitely recommend!,651
296,"If you are looking for a quality pair of headphones but do not want to spend a fortune, look no further!",651
297,I suspect that has more to do with Windows 8 being a terrible OS than anything else.,651
298,"I don't know if something in the vicinity interferes with the connection or what, but I think the convenience of having a bluetooth headset outweighs the few hickups every now and then.",651
299,However they only look good if they are around your neck.,651
300,I had been waiting excitedly to get this item it's cool good reviews what could go wrong?,652
301,"Aside from that minor point, I am thoroughly delighted with my Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones.",652
302,"If you're looking for cheap headphones with potentially great sound quality, you've found them.",652
303,There is no warning anywhere that you shouldn't use it for more intense workouts.,652
304,"The audio quality is superb, but that does not amount to much if you can't stand to wear them.",652
305,I would recommend them highly based on my usage so far.,652
306,I've owned a pair for over three years now.,652
307,"I could probably talk anyone out of the SoundBot and Sonys, but the last two are neck and neck (no pun intended).",652
308,"sorry, slamming this with a one start because it takes a month to ship and no heads up on the description.",652
309,I ended up immediately purchasing Bose AE2i's and am extremely happy with them.,652
310,BUUUUUTTT it does not adjust (guess everyones head is the same size) and the fitting on the ear is small.,652
311,They can get pretty loud.,652
312,They squeeze one's head like a vice.,652
313,I bought the Kinivo BTH240 Headphones approximately one year and 3 months ago primarily for work.,652
314,Arrived very quickly.,652
315,"My son loves this product, and it helps us not have to listen to him playing his video games on his computer.",652
316,If you want your moneys worth than your gonna have to spend a little money to get the quality you want.,652
317,I use these earphones primarily for watching TV while exercising at the gym or to listen to video clips on the computer.,652
318,I haven't had them for long so I don't know how long there going to last.,652
319,"Plus, I'm not super picky about anything as long as I can hear my music clearly and enjoy it.",652
320,The sound quality is nice and it keeps my ears warm in the winter!,652
321,"I read where it is hard to tell which side is L or R, I've found that the R has a small red band making it easy to define it as R.

I read where it needed a battery, there is no battery required.",652
322,"I bought these with a skeptical eye, being that I am familiar with Sony products, I was expecting good sound, but these headphones blew me away!",652
323,"Everything else is great, pairs easily, buttons work well, functions as advertised.",652
324,"I bought them for my 13 year old son, so his stupid games on his stupid tablet don't annoy me (smiley face).",652
325,got these headphones in like february.,653
326,"They work fine for music, but for you tube or vine DO NOT use these they are laggy and uncomfortable to wear.",653
327,For the price you can't beat it.,653
328,He said the sound was great compared to most sets he's had.,653
329,I am very disappointed now though.,653
330,Love this headset.,653
331,These are not the best headphones ever but the sound quality is about the same as a pair of $100 headphones.,653
332,They also stay put.,653
333,It sound like one of the sides was starting to have distortion in it.,653
334,"At first, because these headphones are a little bulky, they got in the way somewhat and caused my earlobs to hurt when using them for an extended period of time.",653
335,He's loves them.,653
336,These are fairly terrible.,653
337,These phones are used by a deaf friend of mine so he can listen to audio books.,653
338,Will see how it holds up long term.,653
339,The price is very cheap for what they're worth.,653
340,"They are not the top of the line, but if you just want comfortable headphones for regular listening...these are great!",653
341,"I wasn't expecting great sound quality for the price, but I did expect them to work.",653
342,"It gives a nice sound quality though, it's worth the buy.",653
343,"As for noise reduction, that doesnt work at all.",653
344,They are comfortable and well worth the price.,653
345,"This is less than that, do not buy these.",653
346,"But they look
pretty cool and i may recommend the seller.",653
347,Sound quality is awesome it could be louder though.,653
348,Personally I feel that they are better.,653
349,"They're priced cheap, another plus.",653
350,I guess you get what you pay for.,654
351,"If you're an active person, save yourself the money and grab a pair of these amazing headphones!",654
352,I was skeptical with what the quality would be like considering the low price.,654
353,It's a lifesaver!,654
354,Connected easy to 2 different phones.,654
355,"I've purchased other headsets around this price point, and each has failed sooner than expected, in ways that seemed traceable to poor design, workmanship, or materials.",654
356,I bought two sets of these for my children (ages 4 and 6) to use on an airplane with their kindles.,654
357,I had those same ones in white and they lasted 3 years of very heavy child use.,654
358,If you are looking for a great house phone Panasonic makes one with Bluetooth so you can charge your Smartphone and still talk.,654
359,These have about half the distance before signal cuts out.,654
360,"I received a 3.5mm male jack, but have easily fixed this foible with an adapter for $0.90.",654
361,Sound wise they equal to much more expensive headsets but this problem is enough to turn you off.,654
362,I have a wonderful 12 yr old who breaks everything that he touches.,654
363,"I have ridiculously rude neighbors, and these help drown out the noise.",654
364,I've had mine for years and they still work.,654
365,Good enough for me since i'm not that person who spends $$$ on audio quality...,654
366,"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.",654
367,Now I keep a pair in my office and my new pair are my daily new daily drivers.,654
368,The headphones fit comfortably and they are snug and do not move while running.,654
369,It's OK if you're not very picky about the sound of your music.,654
370,"It might just be the pair I received, but the range on these are awful when in an open environment (i.e.",654
371,Fantastic sound!,654
372,These headphones are actually a lot better than I was expecting.,654
373,I just didn't take it upon myself to actually see what that size would be.,654
374,Not really worth it.,654
375,"Pros:
Stylish look
Comfortable to wear
Deliver's satisfactory sound quality.",655
376,"Any movement of my head, and the phones slip off and become annoyingly uncomfortable in a hurry.",655
377,Turned out to be a Win-Win!,655
378,"The Kinivo BTH-240's do however sound clean, clear and just as good as high end ear-bud's.",655
379,Some customers had hard time to fit it.,655
380,"Maybe I got a defective product or something, but the volume that I hear things on this headphone is just way too low and because of that it makes it seem like I am listening to everything through muddy water.",655
381,I bought a pair of beats solos and am writing this review with the Sonys on my head.,655
382,The headphone's quality of sound is so great that I recommended this to my friend.,655
383,"This was purchased to go with a pocket voice recorder, and has decent frequency response for voice recordings.",655
384,The  red light was on while plugged in.,655
385,"In conclusion, a great deal (in my opinion), with some nice touches.",655
386,"Sony MDR-ZX100=sad, sloppy, muddy, and uncomfortable on the cartilage to boot.",655
387,Battery life is good for workouts.,655
388,"This was a gift to a friend, but I also have a black one and I use it everyday.",655
389,Price: Amazing price!,655
390,"I bought them to replace my regular earphones, and my first impression was that they are really good.",655
391,Sometimes you read a review once you already own a product that just rings true.,655
392,"The pads were much bigger, and there was the padding at the top too.",655
393,"I originally got these headphones in black a few years back with my Zune and only after getting stepped on, did they break.",655
394,I loved them so much I wore them out.,655
395,The only thing I didn't like was that after a bit the top of my head where the band goes across gets warm ... but that also happens if I so much as wear a hat.,655
396,These headphones were a waste of money!!!!,655
397,"All in all, I would highly recommend these headphones and have recommended them to friends on several occasions.",655
398,I don't know why but I love them!,655
399,They give a really nice sound experience INMHO especially for being fairly inexpensive headphones.,655
400,So the new three star rating is for the company not the headset that gets a two tops.,656
401,Due to the headphones being smaller than my head I feel that the joints of these three pieces that make up the headband are going to snap on me as they do not feel durable.,656
402,The only thing that is hard to navigate is the volume and next track buttons.,656
403,"They do get minorly uncomfortable after about an hour straight of them being on, but then again what headphones don't!",656
404,Honestly I rather have these than spend 200$ on a pair of beats when sound quality is superior for the price.,656
405,Pairing them with my cell phone and my computer haven't been a problem.,656
406,It matches my white Sony Vaio too which is a plus.,656
407,I've had these over a year I think and I have not experienced a short in either cord despite my 4 y.o.,656
408,"They are not what I expected, but they're great for the price.",656
409,The only complaint I have is the cord.,656
410,"That being said, I purchased these for my 14yr old son for Xmas for his mp3.",656
411,We only use these on long trips and they've only been used about 3-4 times.,656
412,These are classics.,656
413,They also got pressed into service as my primary headphones.,656
414,Telephone calls are very clear.,656
415,"It doesn't like the below temps, but it seems like it doesn't affect it... yet.",656
416,I bought these because I'm a hooper and I like to practice in the wee hours when everyone else is asleep.,656
417,I just like to have one for giggles and grins.,656
418,The photo is dead on for color.,656
419,There is no padding on them.,656
420,They do a great job of blocking out external sound.,656
421,Would definitely recommend them!,656
422,I bought my first pair of these in 2013.,656
423,Would rather buy it for $10 instead of $15.,656
424,"All in all, they are priced cheap, but you get a ton of bang for your buck in terms of quality.",656
425,Finally got the time to use my headphones yesterday.,657
426,Fits any head size.,657
427,"I had been searching for days upon days for a headphone, but being the penny pincher that I am I finally found these headphones.",657
428,There was no reason to by the DRE.,657
429,I love these headphones.,657
430,"With these, I get the full surround on my ears, no headaches from the plastic connection, the cord a good length, and the sound is excellent.",657
431,Took a couple times of listening to them to break in the sound quality but they are great for the price.,657
432,Within a couple hours my ears are really hurting.,657
433,"Sound:
+ Mostly full range, loud, crisp and clear in most of the needed range.",657
434,"Things with lots of bass (movies, dance music) have good punch.",657
435,This is more subtle.,657
436,I tried the mdrzx300 and they're too tight and I'm already used to the foldability of these!,657
437,What you get are well constructed headphones with solid performance and very good Sony quality.,657
438,The bass is weak and oppressed.,657
439,I recommend these most highly.,657
440,Item is bent out of shape so I cannot even return it.,657
441,"The most I can say in this case is that I got what I paid for...no more, no less.",657
442,Definitely a bargain.,657
443,Good set of headphones for the price.,657
444,"So far, the overall operations are working well and this is a very nice headset for the price.",657
445,It's not very comfortable either.,657
446,SONY did a good job as a big brand should,657
447,"The white ones are nice in appearance and I liked the red stripe on the right hand side, which makes knowing which side is which very easy at a glance.",657
448,They are the Best I've found for the price.,657
449,"The sound is quite good even on a crowded airplane; the padding around the ears is very comfortable, but also hasn't peeled or frayed.",657
450,Not to loud either so you don't blow the cones out of them lol.,658
451,Not recommend this to anyone!,658
452,"Stays securely in place, even on long runs.",658
453,And I that goes for the two pair that I bought so I know that it wasn't just a lemon that I got.,658
454,Comfy headphones that do not bother me after prolonged usage.,658
455,I would have to say that my one complaint is that the cords tangle and twist so it is hard to be comfortable.,658
456,"Range isn't as far as the 220
2.",658
457,I bought this back in 2014 for school and just to relax with.,658
458,It is sleek modern looking headphones that is even comfortable to wear.,658
459,So I'll use them until they inevitably break...which they quickly will given the crappy cords they're equipped with...and then I'll go to Best Buy and purchase some more real ones at a higher price.,658
460,Great for working around the house.,658
461,Thinner would be better.,658
462,I can barely feel that they are even on my head.,658
463,"they are light weight and confortable, but i wish the cord was a little more longer since i use them in the computer at work and is kinda hard to move around with shoert cord...",658
464,"If a phone call comes in, it auto-switches to answer it.",658
465,I was still using my sony earbuds when I ordered these and I am definitely sticking to the brand now.,658
466,Great phones!!!,658
467,"The sound quality and the bass is very impressive, I might even purchase another one for a family member.",658
468,They fit well on the ears.,658
469,My reference system comprises Beyer Dynamic DT 990 Premium 600 OHM Headphones using Benchmark DAC1 to drive the Beyers.,658
470,"The over the ear design works better than ear buds, which tend to fall out of their little ears.",658
471,I am not happy with them.,658
472,No issues so far.,658
473,"if you listen to music all the time, it may disappoint you.",658
474,"They are extremely loud, which is great in a way because you know the button is actually pressed, but at the same time, isn't very appealing when you're listening to something at a low volume or have overly sensitive ears.",658
475,"These are so comfortable that I can actually sleep in them all night if I want to, although they were not meant for that at all.",659
476,"In their backpacks to listen to music on the bus, at school for various classes, out of the backpack when they were home and countless times of falling asleep with them on, and rolling over onto them in their sleep.",659
477,"The padding rests on your ear instead of around it like other, larger headphones.",659
478,I Olympic weightlift and these do not slip during any movement.,659
479,"When still, it works flawlessly.",659
480,The only negative is the strap around the head is not adjustable and stiff.,659
481,They stay on well even with the sweat and the sound is decent considering the price point of 25.00 I ordered another set for my partner who spends a lot of time doing yard work.,659
482,The MDRZX100 are going to a trash bin.,659
483,I also wanted to buy something very cheap so I don't need to worry about losing it or getting it stolen.,659
484,The other thing is to consider three taps to call as I double tap frequently switching songs and end up calling last number.,659
485,"I bought it for my son, he loves it.",659
486,So they work best when you only pair them to one device and are very careful not to push the wrong buttons.,659
487,Stretching them out helps for a while but even the loosest setting was not enough for me.,659
488,So I am a regular gym goer and I use my headphone while working out.,659
489,It brings an extra breath of life to any song that's playing.,659
490,Audio keeps repeatedly cutting out when there's a slight movement (e.g.,659
491,I am sure this is a good headset but not for what I needed it for.,659
492,"I will divide and conquer by category:

Sound: The sound is the main thing.",659
493,Very nice shape and form.,659
494,I use them at work all the time.,659
495,"Within 5 seconds use could see there is a very noticeable lag in audio and what the video is doing, a second or two delay.",659
496,I emailed the manufacturer about 3 weeks ago and no response.,659
497,I do understand that these are on ear headphones with small drivers.,659
498,"The rigid behind the head bar is just a skotch too small, the phones might fall off if I move carelessly.",659
499,But if your like me then I bet you will be satisfied with the average quality.,659
500,These probably aren't really good for music.,660
501,"The ""Red"" band on the right side, denotes which ear which is good since it's very hard to read the symbols telling you otherwise.",660
502,"I think that it was designed for a no longer satisfaction, i don't want buying another one, i'm afraid i lost my money.",660
503,I transcribe dictation at home and needed new headphones for my machine.,660
504,Not clear if you can use a cigarette lighter USB charger in car or truck to supply charging power to the headphone when out and about.,660
505,For the money...they work well.,660
506,Just the quality Sony put into these $20 headphones!,660
507,"Got what I wanted, nuff said.",660
508,These earphones are good but I wish they didn't feel so tight.,660
509,The 90 degree plug is bulky and  rather awkward.,660
510,I wouldn't waste my money on these due to the poor design.,660
511,They fit so comfortably and nicely!,660
512,My old Logitech headphones were way better.,660
513,Definitely a great buy!,660
514,For the price you can't beat it.,660
515,"I think if a person wants an average, inexpensive set set of headphones it would be hard to go wrong with these.",660
516,"back on they go...she is disabled so i,m glad to have  something of good quality that she gets so much joy from,  and at a reasonable price,  thanks again.",660
517,"They might be good for children, or as a spare pair, but I wouldn't recommend them for your primary set of headphones.",660
518,"FINALLY, we have it!",660
519,"Haven't really tested out the battery life or durability yet, but I suspect they will be more than sufficient.",660
520,It sticks out and just dangles in the air like a wild hair.,660
521,"Sometimes I can keep a connection on the opposite side of my house from my iPhone 4S (yes, I know it's dated, but come on!).",660
522,"The treble is generally a little low, but you can change your EQ settings and it'll be fine.",660
523,"Ears eventually start hurting from wearing too long
3.",660
524,"When you listen to any song, you can occasionally hear background instruments or percussion very well, this can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the way you view your music.",660
525,"Also, it creaks and it doesn't feel like a quality craftsmanship.",661
526,Connection gets disturbed occationally but nothing to really complain about.,661
527,Thinkin about ordering another pair for home.,661
528,Even though I dropped it more times than I can count.,661
529,The sound quality is biased towards the bass side of neutral which is not my preference - but we are discussing $14.00 phones!,661
530,I also love the bluetooth - I feel so free.,661
531,The fit is comfortable as well and do not feel like they are putting your skull in a vise yet there is no danger of them falling off.,661
532,"I still battle with hearing people on my end, particularly in a noisy environment.",661
533,It's not uncomfortable but it does feel like they're going to get pushed off your ears if you're laying back against something.,661
534,These are a great fit for my small head.,661
535,My only complaint... No padding on the headband does start to hurt the top of my head but I will like just glue a strip of phone to the underside and call it good.,661
536,I even got a hug 3 days ago from the 9 year old for buying them.,661
537,I am not a techo geek.,661
538,I purchased the LG tone pro afterward and was diss appointed because they were twice as expensive and half the quality.,661
539,"The portion that wraps around your ear can get a little sore and annoying after a while, but just a little adjusting and it will go away.",661
540,"I received a replacement set within a few days, with no hassle.",661
541,"Easy to wear (not uncomfortable), stay on my ears when i need them to, not much else to say.",661
542,Not the fault of the manufacturer.),661
543,I've changed the rating to the 5 stars this replacement pair deserves.,661
544,It has a good level of keeping outside noises out but not to the extent where you can't hear anything.,661
545,She absolutely loves them.,661
546,I don't know if I should get these or the new ones...,661
547,"The only issue I've encountered is that I like to use this pair with multiple devices (phone/tablet/computer), and on occasion I have to repair.",661
548,I'm going to use it to watch videos.,661
549,Only item I didn't like was that the headstrap is not adjustable.,661
550,"They sound great, and function intuitively.",662
551,"For the price, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.",662
552,"Note that these are the sports-type of headphones, and instead of going over the top of the head, they go behind the neck.",662
553,Fast delivery and great product.,662
554,These headphones can get pretty loud too.,662
555,Very impressed with how long they can go without a charge.,662
556,So that means they still need to improve the microphones on the stereo headsets.,662
557,"If you want bumping phenomenal bass, go pay $300.00 for a pair of Bose headphones.",662
558,Very comfortable too.,662
559,This headphones are unbeatable for this price.,662
560,Always buy new ones!,662
561,I bought these headphones due to a review by the wirecutter and I can say that it lived up to their praise.,662
562,"When making calls, I can hear others and they can hear me, even with the windows down in the car.",662
563,"There is no adjustment for size, like some high-end (and high dollar) phones.",662
564,I purchased them to listen to audiobooks on various devices.,662
565,Used them for my workouts until one day (after a owning them only a month) they stopped holding a charge.,662
566,Sound isn't high enough and there's NO BASS at all.,662
567,These headphones were purchased for my wife and I.,662
568,"Amazing product regardless, though!",662
569,Love these headphones especially since they weren't too expensive.,662
570,Perfect for working out.,662
571,They stay put once adjusted.,662
572,Bought in January.,662
573,"Typically, I have my iPhone in my pocket or on the desk I'm sitting at or in the space on the treadmill where you set down your devices.",662
574,"These are not the best headphones in the world, but they might just be the best $15 headphones in the world.",662
575,I have to physically move the sound system's volume meter to be able to reach.,663
576,I've owned the BHT220 for years...they finally started acting up so I jumped to these.,663
577,"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.",663
578,"They're low priced, but get the job done.",663
579,They sound phenomenal.,663
580,Another thing I noticed is that they aren't really loud.,663
581,"Lightweight, feels comfortable around ears, and provides above-average sound for the price.",663
582,"I usually don't take the time to review things, but this product is an exception I feel that these headphone comparing them to beats on display at the store are almost better.",663
583,The fit is not quite as comfortable as some I've tried.,663
584,"After receiving them timely, putting one set on the shelf, I hooked up the first set.",663
585,"Both our birthdays are coming next month so I thought I'd buy one, check it out and get another one if I like.",663
586,I trust and love Kiniv.,663
587,"I don't give 5 stars lightly, but this is about as good a deal as I've seen on headphones in a long time.",663
588,"Regardless, they have been the longest lasting headphones I've ever owned.",663
589,If you are looking for legit stereo sound without paying an outrageous amount these are for you.,663
590,they fold up and fit nicely in his backpack.,663
591,"I still battle with hearing people on my end, particularly in a noisy environment.",663
592,A great buy and would recommend.,663
593,Came quickly and works well!,663
594,Connected easy to 2 different phones.,663
595,I love the way it sounds and feels.,663
596,"So, I don't know how these hold up to active uses.",663
597,"If you're just looking for decent headphones for occasional use at a reasonable price, these are worth your consideration.",663
598,Not tight fitting at all and would fall of if you have to bend down quickly to pick something up.,663
599,They fit  a little tight at first but I got used to them.,663
600,I wanted to experiment with bluetooth headphones and these were a solid but low cost way to try them out.,664
601,"I chose Sony because the extension connecting the headphones to any device is flexible, thus allowing the headphones to last longer despite.",664
602,I could only hear through one side.,664
603,I use them almost every day for at least an hour.,664
604,I think these things will cause wear over time and cause these sort of issues.,664
605,Couldn't ask for anything better!,664
606,"He says they are
 fantastic.",664
607,"Since these cover the ear, I figured I'd give them a shot.",664
608,I plan on buying another pair soon.,664
609,"The sound is great in these things and they're not very expensive, either.",664
610,"Pros: comfortable fit, relatively lightweight for being larger headphones, great sound quality, easy to wear and easy to use; noise canceling ""enough"" for the price!",664
611,Maybe it's supposed to do that for when you just want to let them hang around your neck but that certainly doesn't make them anymore comfortable.,664
612,I'm going to use it to watch videos.,664
613,"Overall they are probably better for ST listening, not something you could fall asleep in.",664
614,The device wouldn't charge at all so it was basically rendered useless.,664
615,The problem is the things pinch my head.,664
616,In regards to sound it does fine.,664
617,"They sound fine, and work okay if I am sitting still..",664
618,"The Good:
Well built.",664
619,"I didn't expect much for under $20, but if you consider yourself even slightly more concerned with quality than the average user, I'd get something else.",664
620,Quality Headphones for the money.,664
621,"Battery life seems okay, but I tend to just keep mine on the charger when they are not in use.",664
622,I had the older versions of this headset and they worked great and this one is no exception.,664
623,A nice purchase.,664
624,It is a great set of headphones for the price.,664
625,Another thing I noticed is that they aren't really loud.,665
626,The sound is good enough for general listening.,665
627,"Also, they look really bad haha.",665
628,overall a great purchase for a great price!,665
629,I like the fact that I can lay the ear muff flat so I can just slip it my computer case.,665
630,I am returning them and buying a new pair once more hopefully these will not cut in and out.,665
631,I bought the Kinivo BTH240 Headphones approximately one year and 3 months ago primarily for work.,665
632,They fold up nicely and have stood up to the inside of my purse (sturdy!),665
633,It's actually big enough for regular people.,665
634,"Everyone is quick to bash on Skullcandy, but in my case at least, my $35 Skullcandy's are far superior to these $15 Sony's.",665
635,Sony you should be ashamed!!!,665
636,"Good sound, fine bass that does not overpower the mids and highs.",665
637,"The sound is slightly better than low-end to mid-range in ears or ear-buds, but surprisingly not by much.",665
638,They where very comfortable and soft so I was very disappointed.,665
639,I also wear hearing aids and these work great and are comfortable over them.,665
640,They are painful if you wear them very long.,665
641,Just got these a couple days ago and I'm very pleased.,665
642,BTW its only day 1 so I will follow up with how they hold up in the long run.,665
643,for someone who is really clumsy and is used to breaking headphones all the time this is perfect.,665
644,I BOUGHT A 2ND SET FOR MY WIFE TO PRACTICE HER GUITAR THRU A SMALL AMP AND SHE LOVES THEM AS WELL.,665
645,For the price you can't beat it.,665
646,"I'm not an audio nerd, so my review is just based on an average user who distinguishes headphones by ""it sounds good"" or ""it doesnt sound too great.""",665
647,They still work as well as they did the day I got them.,665
648,Discomfort sets in after a few hours (I've been streaming a lot of Breaking Bad).,665
649,On Windows 8 it can be very difficult to figure out if you have bluetooth and how to turn it on.,665
650,"For those that never tried a pair of middle to upper grade headphones, these are sure to delight.",666
651,"They would no longer hold a charge so I upgraded to this model, the BTH240.",666
652,Over the ear without encasing my whole head and heating me up.,666
653,I would not recommend this to a person who plans to wear headphones for more than 45mins per use.,666
654,Turned out to be a Win-Win!,666
655,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,666
656,These are light and comfortable for long periods - I wear them all day at work.,666
657,"He told me to try a ""factory reset"" but that didn't work.",666
658,If it turns out that it is just my phone and it works great on other stuff then yeah I would suggest it.,666
659,The jack is finicky and doesn't always connect to my computer right away.,666
660,"Would certainly buy from them again, hopefully these hold up to the daily use while hubby works out",666
661,I can't use earbuds and corded phones are such a nuisance.,666
662,**the instruction book that comes with the headset specifies the A2DP setting and once i figured out how to set that properly i've had no issues.,666
663,"The sound quality is also a 10, just enough bass.",666
664,Can take a beating from my 5 year old and my 6 year old.,666
665,"They have a decent bass sound but it is lacking in that deep rumble, however it does sound very good.",666
666,My last pair were with me for daily use for almost 4 years and only had to be replaced when my cat helpfully chewed through the cord.,666
667,These are almost too good to be true.,666
668,They come with a micro usb charging cable and a velvet-like pouch for storage.,666
669,This is actually my second Sony MDRZX100 headphones.,666
670,I suppose this thing is good for rock or rap...when deep bass pounding is wanted.,666
671,"i wanna know if it's possible that if i send this back and they can give me a refund, or give me one that works.",666
672,I can't believe how small this headset really is.,666
673,These are almost too good to be true.,666
674,"Even though, it isn't better than beats they still make AWESOME headphones!!",666
675,These are keepers.,667
676,"Rather sturdy, feels like it won't break too easily, I'll let you know how that goes.",667
677,The Panasonic RP-HT21 is head and shoulders above the Sony MDRZX100.,667
678,I can't hold the ipod in my hand all the time.,667
679,"This have good sound and okay bass,  they do need more treble but overall good product for the price.",667
680,"Also, the padding around the earpieces is quite comfortable and doesn't allow much sound leakage at all.",667
681,These phones are just great!,667
682,Great headphones and a great price.,667
683,i walk around w/o iphone in my hand in the house and it still sound great.,667
684,Just note that isolation is nonexistant on this one.,667
685,These are some of the sturdiest headphones I've owned.,667
686,Plenty loud enough for most users and insanely long battery life.,667
687,I had the same problem as the first reviewer...won't hold a charge.,667
688,"Sound quality is very good for $14 and shipping was prompt with Amazon Prime

Great buy for casual listening",667
689,"The reason being, is because after a while, the plastic starts to hurt the top of your head if they are not correctly fitted to your head.",667
690,I have dropped them once or twice and they still work.,667
691,They weren't awkwardly bulky or small.,667
692,These headphones are nice.,667
693,Bass is actually quite well and you will enjoy listening to your music on these.,667
694,The sound quality is very good and has good strong bass.,667
695,I've carried them in my Targus messenger bag for the past couple of months with ease.,667
696,Mids and highs are very clear and crisp.,667
697,"I have ridiculously rude neighbors, and these help drown out the noise.",667
698,"I have ridiculously rude neighbors, and these help drown out the noise.",667
699,Well worth the buy.,667
700,So far very happy with them.,668
701,Bought these specifically to use with my Dish Network Hopper.,668
702,"After poking around the sound properties for this device, I found that it was set to Telephony quality sound format (single channel) with no option to upgrade it to CD or DVD quality (which I thought was pretty much the standard these days).",668
703,I have to buy a second one becuase i broke the wire to the left speaker,668
704,"I'm sure some people could care less about that, so take my review for what it is, my opinion.",668
705,This is definitely worth your money,668
706,*Comfortable Secure Fit.,668
707,I would love to give these 5 stars.....but these have their issues.,668
708,I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them like beats etc.,668
709,Unfortunately i have gone through 2 pairs of these and both no longer work within 2-3 months of using them 5-6 days a week.,668
710,"unfortunately, they are a little too flimsy for my taste and it  took me a while to use them.",668
711,Connected easily to my iPhone and iPad and they block out most of the outside noise.,668
712,They bluetooth well and do just what they say.,668
713,1) There is a loss of sound separation in the mid-ranges.,668
714,These headphones are definitely better than some but they aren't anything to write home about.,668
715,Very impressed with how long they can go without a charge.,668
716,My only complaint is that I wish it didn't have a split cable.,668
717,"So, my solution was to get wireless headphones.",668
718,The short synopsis is these items work fantastic!!!,668
719,"Under $20 though, I'm not complaining.",668
720,The latest versions allow you to connect to multiple devices simultaneously.,668
721,"Overall very satisfied - it's also very cost efficient compared to its competitors, will keep updated as far as wear and tear.",668
722,My earbuds are stronger and are more comfortable.,668
723,"Other than that, regardless of how I have it on, it fits well enough that I can't complain.",668
724,EDIT: cheap fix for more comfortable headphones is to tuck 1~2 stretched cotton balls into the pads.,668
725,"If star ratings were correlated with price, this would be 5 stars.",669
726,"But if you're like me and would rather not spend hundreds of dollars on headphones, these work just fine.",669
727,the ear piece rotates side ways and long ways.,669
728,"My only complaint is that they're described as ""noise cancelling"" and they definitely are not.",669
729,Would buy another pair if I needed one.,669
730,This is actually the second pair of these that I've purchased.,669
731,"Theses were touted as noise-cancelling or noise reducing, but did neither - They also sound very thin with very little bass.",669
732,These sound great!,669
733,"I bought these for somebody else and they didn't like them, but I started using them and I use them all of the time now.",669
734,"I have had a number of Bluetooth stereo headsets including the last version of these, and I must say these are the best for the money I have found.",669
735,No PIN; they rely on a pairing mode for security.,669
736,The white is pretty classy in my opinion.,669
737,Also syncing took a great deal of attempts and time to work.,669
738,The cheap Sony brand works just fine.,669
739,He thought he'd never find one like it.,669
740,"Amazing product regardless, though!",669
741,I tested these headphones on both my iPod touch and my PC and they both play beautifully but if you want it for use on your computer note that the cord is no more than two feet of extra cord.,669
742,The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that I was hoping it would fit over my ears and not sit on them.,669
743,I'm returning them and will investigate if it was just a manufacturing issue.,669
744,I would definitely go with these headphones,669
745,But after 1 day of use I can hear a rattle as if something is loose in the right earpiece after just 1 day of use.,669
746,"I'm a musician so I'm always looking for great studio heaphones or personal monitors, these headphones are worth every penny!",669
747,"Behringer phones best sound output, bests the Philips, can handle volume, but emit vinyl fumes.",669
748,5) No clicking sound from the buttons as reported by other users.,669
749,I bought one of these 2 years ago.,669
750,"These Sony headphones, while not fancy, certainly fit the bill.",670
751,The 10-hour rating for battery life seems right.,670
752,The 220s didn't have that problem.,670
753,Outstanding product.,670
754,"After reading good reviews, I settled on these and I'm glad I did.",670
755,"For use with my IPad, the volume is a little low even at the max when watching Netflix.",670
756,Will not be purchasing this model again.,670
757,I could not hear announcements but could hear enough to know they were making one.,670
758,"that I woke someone up by calling them at a bad hour, I knew these were unacceptable.",670
759,The MDRZX100 are going to a trash bin.,670
760,Received product within 5 days and was well packaged for delivery.,670
761,The service from the vendor was excellent.,670
762,"Sound quality is the same which is good, but they do not quite fit my large head and are not quite as comfortable.",670
763,It was a great purchase.,670
764,"However, after bumping my first song on it, I immediately felt 100% satisfied with my purchase.",670
765,The charge held for a long time and the sound was decent.,670
766,There was nothing misleading in the description - I think it states 47 1/2 inches and this is accurate.,670
767,"Up to now it works fine, no music ""skipped"" at all.",670
768,"When they work, they're fine, but they seem to lose their charge too quickly.",670
769,Incoming phone call?,670
770,I was mad but when I put on the head phones I was very happy!,670
771,I have been very happy up until now.,670
772,"I think there are room for improvements, but for the price, it is worth purchasing.",670
773,"(Anyway, these puppies look nerdy enough on your ears; if anyone saw you speaking into the ether with them on they'd wonder where your aluminum foil cap was.)",670
774,"My first pair that I bought years ago stopped holding a charge, so I switched brands.",670
775,MY SON IS 10 AND I WOULDN'T DARE SPEND WHAT BEATS COST FOR HIM YET!!!!,671
776,"As you can gather from the title of this review, the product does not cancel noise.",671
777,First pair lasted 22 months with no issue.,671
778,Love this headset.,671
779,"Although they are mainly plastic, they are quite durable as I've used them virtually everyday since I purchased them in January of this year.",671
780,It's easy to switch to accept or make a phone call.,671
781,For the price paid these are decent headphones.,671
782,The package was nice and not hard to unwrap.,671
783,"I am changing the volume on the device, but it isn't in the perfect spot it was earlier.",671
784,They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these).,671
785,I don't wear it for long periods of time cause it get uncomfortable.,671
786,It also appears that the noise cancellation logic struggles when the input signal is low.,671
787,"I love that it adjusts, and it's easy to figure out which side is right vs. left (the red color goes on the right, by the way).",671
788,"I do feel them on my ears, but it is not uncomfortable.",671
789,she crapped out on she so soon in less than a month  tried fo retuen it but it was going to cost $19 to return almost the same amount to.purchase it.,671
790,"But for quick easy portable, these are pretty good to be honest.",671
791,Most of people said it is good for all part.,671
792,I guess since they cover the ears they really block out a decent amount of outside noise leaving just music.,671
793,should the replacement 240's work I will update my review.,671
794,I bought a pair of beats solos and am writing this review with the Sonys on my head.,671
795,They are one ear so noise is not shut out completely.,671
796,The headphone's quality of sound is so great that I recommended this to my friend.,671
797,"For those of you don't need the volume up quite as high like for walking or watching a dvd in a car, etc.",671
798,I also own the venerable V6's.,671
799,Bought these because a lot of people were giving them crazy good reviews saying they were amazing for the money.,671
800,"It is pretty hard to press, making it difficult to turn and off and making it easy to give the wrong command.",672
801,Disclosure: Kinivo provided me the Kinivo BTH240.,672
802,I can use them for an hour or so without getting tired of them.,672
803,I highly recommend them.,672
804,15% Discount gets you 1000 sales.,672
805,"2) The headband does not have any padding, and this caused a little bit of discomfort for me.",672
806,"I was going to send them back, but my husband (who does not have any type of TMJ or jaw ache issues) decided to keep them as jogging headphones.",672
807,I purchased these headphones because my dad wanted a pair of headphones when he went to work out and go about his daily routine.,672
808,These have held up for months without issue.,672
809,"The audio quality is superb, but that does not amount to much if you can't stand to wear them.",672
810,I'm not concerned about them falling off.,672
811,Bought this model upon recommendation from a friend who had used the previous model for about a year.,672
812,I'd recommend these to anyone looking to get high quality without breaking the bank.,672
813,"Battery life seems okay, but I tend to just keep mine on the charger when they are not in use.",672
814,"I like the Kinivo, and I will continue searching for a different BT transmitter that will hopefully pair successfully.",672
815,Perhaps there was a microphone upgrade of some kind.,672
816,"I might be a little concerned about the ear pieces fabric fraying because of sweat, but as long as the sound stays good I don't much care.",672
817,"But for the price, I think that these are way more than worth it if you need a cheap pair of headphones that will last you longer than twinkies in the post nuclear world.",672
818,If you have hair this probably won't be an issue but its worth a mention.,672
819,"Would certainly buy from them again, hopefully these hold up to the daily use while hubby works out",672
820,-The bluetooth signal is pretty good on these.,672
821,"They either don't fit my ears right, pop out, or short out.",672
822,The wrap around style is super comfortable and never bounces/falls off.,672
823,And it allows me to be able to speak to the little kids without trying to speak above the sounds from his math blasting out from the speakers!,672
824,"Bass is nice and clear, beat's quality without the hype and 100x price tag.",672
825,i say get them in black because they can get dirty but easy to clean.,673
826,I don't recommend these,673
827,I am overall very impressed with this company.,673
828,"Gave to my 12 year old grandson and he was so very excited, spent the rest of Christmas vacation with them on his head listening to music almost all the time.",673
829,"I don't like ear buds, so wearing only over the ear headphones is the only way I can enjoy private audio experiences.",673
830,"While this a negative, I don't want to wear any headphones much longer than that anyway because it's just not good for your ears.",673
831,The sound is very good.,673
832,I've changed the rating to the 5 stars this replacement pair deserves.,673
833,There have been other comments about sound quality not the greatest because of being Bluetooth but I think they sound fine.,673
834,"The ends both turn flat, which is great for packing them in my bag with my books.",673
835,The sound is decent and they are pretty sturdy.,673
836,"I recommend these to anyone that wants a good, affordable pair of headphones!",673
837,"I have tried multiple phones and eventually they all disconnect for a moment depending on whether the phone is upside down, or which pocket I have the phone in.",673
838,"Only $25 bucks so we can expect the world, but a solid $25 investment.",673
839,"It could have been a number of things, like my phone had too many apps on, Pandora lost connection or something, but I never experienced those problems while on a corded headset.",673
840,"I owned a similar pair of Sony headphones about ten years ago, and for the price there is no better pair that you can get.",673
841,"The sound is fine, exactly what you'd expect from Sony, even at $16 for the headphones.",673
842,"the ear piece is kinda small so it doesn't fight over your ear, just press against it, like I said the ear piece is really soft and nicely made so it doesn't hurt, but after a while it does heat up my ear.",673
843,I could not imagine having these in white.,673
844,You'll get distortion at about 80% on your iDevice.,673
845,They are not noise canceling and they are bulky.,673
846,Exactly as pictured.,673
847,"Obviously, they do not have the fit/sound quality of $200 headphones, but at the price point, there is no competition to the BTH240.",673
848,They fit pretty well around my ear and have no issues with them falling off when lifting weights or running on a treadmill.,673
849,For the money you can't go wrong.,673
850,"Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.",674
851,"For $15, these are probably some of the best sounding headphones you can buy.",674
852,ALSO it came in black-not white.,674
853,"They're also lightly made, so I won't be surprised if the padding wears out or something snaps, but for this price they're easily replaced.",674
854,Might give this to my more petite wife and find something else!,674
855,"My sister bought these for me for Christmas, they were on my wishlist, regardless, they are awesome.",674
856,Highly recommended.,674
857,I got these for my daughter's 12th birthday and she loves them.,674
858,After looking for a while Igave up and just bought cheap... WELL little did I know that they would be just what I wanted.,674
859,Middle range is also fine.,674
860,"Without a little ear bud that I have to drill into my ear, avoiding earring studs, they rest very comfortable around my ears and don't make me feel like I'm doing a wax extraction every time I remove them.",674
861,"They are comfortable, and drown out sound pretty well.",674
862,These headphones have a great noise isolation and you just can't hear much else but your music.,674
863,I'm 5 foot 8 and I suspect my head is about average size for my height and they fit perfectly.,674
864,I'm not sure if I'm crazy or not but it makes sense as the right ear is the one with all the controls.,674
865,"My only complaint about these is that they emphasize bass a little too much, but they're definitely a solid option if you're looking for an inexpensive set of headphones for your office or when you're on the subway.",674
866,"I have 4 pair just lying around the house, so that when someone wants to use them, they can.",674
867,I'll update my review once I sweat in these for a month or so during workouts.,674
868,"Nice design, they fit very well and are very confortable,  great sound, easy to vinculate to my iPhone and tablet, the controls on the headphone work great and the range of connection is great.",674
869,"They fit her perfectly and they were what she wanted (over the ear, cutting out outside noise) with good sound.",674
870,"I also have been using it at the gym for about 2 hours at a time, it handles great.",674
871,These are great by any standard.,674
872,"At first, because these headphones are a little bulky, they got in the way somewhat and caused my earlobs to hurt when using them for an extended period of time.",674
873,"Of course they do not get as good sound as my Beats by Dr. Dre Studio's, but great overall value.",674
874,They go in the backpack with lunch box and everything else squished and squashed :-).,674
875,These headsets are awesome.,675
876,I didn't use them every day maybe 2-3 times a week.,675
877,The sound is great and easily the most value you will find in a quality set of headphones in my opinion.,675
878,(they sounded a lot better) I went back online to find a pair of the rocketfish.,675
879,"Up until last night, I was really kind of bragging about how great the second set had been.",675
880,"For the price, the sounds is awesome and really makes you feel you are right in either the concert or movie theater!",675
881,The head phones worked great for 5 months and then one side of the headphone s broke and you can't hear anything on the left side but other than that they are pretty good,675
882,"Please, do not blame the messenger.",675
883,"Obviously I can hear well enough or I would have replaced them, but still.",675
884,Then finally the exterior bridge that holds the phones on the bar broke.,675
885,For the price and quality I'd buy them again.,675
886,"They're also lightly made, so I won't be surprised if the padding wears out or something snaps, but for this price they're easily replaced.",675
887,"I don't give 5 stars lightly, but this is about as good a deal as I've seen on headphones in a long time.",675
888,Turns out they are uncomfortable for me.,675
889,Just want I needed.,675
890,The material appears sturdy enough.,675
891,Then I joined a gym with the MUSIC LOOP FROM HELL.,675
892,I just gave that headset to my son when he went to college and bought the BHT240.,675
893,The sound quality is good.,675
894,So far I really like them.,675
895,"Aside from that minor point, I am thoroughly delighted with my Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones.",675
896,"I bought the new one because I lost the other ones again, and I wanted a separate pair for work.",675
897,Much better than I expected.,675
898,This pair must have a short it never stays connected it beeps all day long going in and out.,675
899,"The sound is great, and mind you I do use them daily, but within 5 months of purchase, both sides of the headset are dead.",675
900,I love these headphones.,676
901,The sound on these headphones is great.,676
902,"Its sturdy and can withstand abuse (tossing it onto the table, for example) and the wires are thicker than your average $5 headphones.",676
903,Thus far she is loving them.,676
904,"I had been using a wired set, but let's face it, the wires are always getting tangled or caught on things.",676
905,":)

My little guy likes them also!",676
906,Now I can listen in comfort.,676
907,Now I keep a pair in my office and my new pair are my daily new daily drivers.,676
908,I like this much better.,676
909,So I bought a pair for my wife.,676
910,There is no warning anywhere that you shouldn't use it for more intense workouts.,676
911,"I am not a professional dj, and nor is my daughter;)",676
912,"They're not exactly power performers, but then again, you're paying less than $20.",676
913,Turns out they are uncomfortable for me.,676
914,"I use it when I'm gaming, doing homework, watching a movie in the Library, basically all the time.",676
915,Thank you Kinivo for headphones that don't require charging after a few hours.,676
916,I bought these headphones because I needed something for my digital media class and I didn't want to spend a fortune.,676
917,I used these mainly for going to the gym.,676
918,Great little cheapo headphones.,676
919,"They could be uncomfortable if you have glasses, as the frame could get pressed against your ear.",676
920,"I loved these white headphones, they are of good quality and portable.",676
921,If you read these reviews you would think otherwise.,676
922,We could hardly hear it.,676
923,You can turn up the sound pretty loud and it sounds amazing.,676
924,"While I viewed them as a holdover until I could afford something higher-end like the Jaybirds Bluebuds X, I may end up putting off that decision longer than I anticipated!",676
925,These will be great for traveling.,677
926,I went a whole week using them without having to recharge.,677
927,"If you want bumping phenomenal bass, go pay $300.00 for a pair of Bose headphones.",677
928,The headphones arrived on time and in good shape.,677
929,"This is my second pair of Kinivo headset, I own the BTH220 and the BTH240 is a nice upgrade, buttons feel much better.",677
930,"For a Dark Side of the Moon session, you'll want better.",677
931,"The handiness of bluetooth combine with how small and lightweight the item is to create the perfect ""jogger's headphones"".",677
932,Feels very comfortable.,677
933,I bought one for work then I bought another for home.,677
934,$15 for over the ear headphones is a good price.,677
935,I wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid.,677
936,I'm no audiophile.,677
937,"I don't personally have any complaints because for the price, they are very good sounding headphones.",677
938,These solve both problems!,677
939,Amazing Headphone.,677
940,I bought these headphones because I needed something for my digital media class and I didn't want to spend a fortune.,677
941,The quality of the sound is very decent considering the low price point of these headphones.,677
942,The sound wouldn't come out after that mishap.,677
943,"i also haven't been very gentle with them, so i tend to take them off by sliding them off one ear and kinda yanking them off the other in one swift motion...and the frame hasn't twisted or bent in any way.",677
944,"I'm going to  keep them because my ears are hurting too much from my earlier pair, and these $15 jobbers are very comfortable.",677
945,"Have only had these a few days but initial impressions are ""pretty"" good.",677
946,"The ear piece is a bit big, but you get an amazing sound from them almost like stereo head srt.",677
947,"I thought they sounded great, I'm sure others are better but these are so cost effective I could buy a pair for less then $30 which is amazing.",677
948,I have enjoyed them while listening to hours of Pandora at my desk without any notice of inferior sound quality.,677
949,"Since these are not in ear, when you put the volume pretty loud, other people can hear your music.",677
950,"""They work"" is about all I can say about these headphones.",678
951,"Then one day when I was trying to charge it, the red light turned on for 30 seconds or so and turned off right away.",678
952,Headphones relatively comfortable.,678
953,They are sturdy and have excellent sound for how much they cost.,678
954,The sound is good enough for general listening.,678
955,"Overall, I highly recommend them for the average listener, but not for the audiophile snob types.",678
956,The headsets don't mush your head and they are very clear.,678
957,"I can't recommend this item, and I hope they can improve the headphones.",678
958,They are comfortable.,678
959,Sound is great!,678
960,These are terribly uncomfortable.,678
961,Discomfort sets in after a few hours (I've been streaming a lot of Breaking Bad).,678
962,"This have good sound and okay bass,  they do need more treble but overall good product for the price.",678
963,"They work great, are light, and pair quickly with my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 tablets.",678
964,I bought this color and the white one for my kids that last longer than other brands.,678
965,I have enjoyed them while listening to hours of Pandora at my desk without any notice of inferior sound quality.,678
966,"However, for me, it's really minimal.",678
967,I started my music player on my phone and the sound was great.,678
968,"At first, because these headphones are a little bulky, they got in the way somewhat and caused my earlobs to hurt when using them for an extended period of time.",678
969,"Once in a while, they'd nip one of my hairs in the joints.",678
970,"It has a perfect sound, of course we can not compare with other more expensive headphones, but it is great!",678
971,Mids and highs are great now.,678
972,My husband finally tested it and discovered that only the left side worked.,678
973,I'm not a music mixer or anyone with an ear for sound that has specific needs.,678
974,"So anyway the gadget is great, but I needed some headphones.",678
975,I'm only glad that I ended up with black instead of the ugly green ones.,679
976,They are fantastic!,679
977,I highly recommend it.,679
978,You will love not having to deal with cords.,679
979,Highly recommended.,679
980,These have a really good sound for the price.,679
981,Comfortable on my head.,679
982,"Overall, they are well worth the money.",679
983,Loud if you want them to be.,679
984,It's a good set of headphones for the price.,679
985,"If you want some over the head earphones and you don't want to spend more than 30 dollars, these are a must buy.",679
986,I will return this product.,679
987,I purchased these headphone exclusively for listening to movies via my Roku 3 Remote Controller which has an Stereo Audio Output Jack for private listening.,679
988,I purchase the BTH240 and the BTD-400 bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter for my Dell laptop which I had recently converted from WIN7 to Ubuntu Linux 14.04.,679
989,I look forward to Kinivo's next model.,679
990,I did have a small problem.,679
991,Bought these for my wife.,679
992,"Come on people, they are not comparable Bose or Beats but for a good pair of knock around headphones, theses are good to go.",679
993,They are fine for everyday listening.,679
994,I have medium sized ears and they hang off.,679
995,If not for the jack being as pictured I would have given this product 5 stars.,679
996,The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that I was hoping it would fit over my ears and not sit on them.,679
997,If anything ever happens to them we will definitely be repurchasing!,679
998,"I am purchasing another pair today so I can have a dedicated unit for work, I am confident my old pair will continue to perform for the next year so in my locker they go!",679
999,My original pair of BTH240's were great.,679
1000,"I don't ever review, but these headphones are worth it.",680
1001,I like them better than beats.,680
1002,paired with my iphone5 - they aren't loud enough for my type of use ( mountain bike riding - working out- running) .,680
1003,"I was able to put it back in and use it still, but it pops out still every now and again.",680
1004,"THEY FIT VERY WELL AND IT DOES HAVE A 3.5MM PLUG, SO I BOUGHT ADAPTERS FOR THE 1/4"" STANDARD FROM MY AMPS.",680
1005,I bought these for 29 dollars and they beat out headsets that have an msrp of three times the price.,680
1006,For the price these are fantastic!,680
1007,I loved them so much I wore them out.,680
1008,The build isn't the best.,680
1009,Great product!!,680
1010,Pros - They are made for traveling.,680
1011,"durable on the touch feeling
easy access, fast connect with bluetooth
comfortable on ears
looks like premium product with cheap price
worth every penny",680
1012,and the sound is EXCELLENT!!!,680
1013,Getting another pair only because I can't find my first pair!,680
1014,"I'm going to  keep them because my ears are hurting too much from my earlier pair, and these $15 jobbers are very comfortable.",680
1015,"As usual, the cord seems to be about 6 inches shorter than I need.",680
1016,"For anyone that complains about the sound quality, THEY ARE $15.00.",680
1017,I started my music player on my phone and the sound was great.,680
1018,"Other reviews on the newer 240 mentioned that the bar is closer to the head, so I thought this problem with the 220 would be lessened.",680
1019,Main reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is they can feel loose at times if I am doing more intense workouts.,680
1020,So a nice design.,680
1021,"I wanted to see how low impedance headphones would work with this amplifier, whether I would hear any hiss or hum with such low impedance headphones, and the amplifier passed with flying colors.",680
1022,"I say, if you want brand A quality then buy brand A.",680
1023,Took a few tries before I could turn off the item well.,680
1024,better then what i expected i recommend this item they feel good look nice and they do not look cheap i give this item 5 stars got to me on time and really good,680
1025,There was nothing misleading in the description - I think it states 47 1/2 inches and this is accurate.,681
1026,That may have more to do with my big noggin than anything else.,681
1027,"But they look
pretty cool and i may recommend the seller.",681
1028,"They definitely get the job done and for the price, there really isn't any complaint I could make.",681
1029,This Sony product is the best stereo headphone I have purchased to date and it exceeded my expectations.,681
1030,"The sound quality is some of the best I have experienced with headphones under $20, you can get a fair bit of bass and easily enough volume to block out the noise around you without blowing out your ears.",681
1031,Those without such issues or not looking for any noise blocking qualities will love these headphones.,681
1032,These work great.,681
1033,They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these).,681
1034,I purchased these to use as hands free calling.,681
1035,"They don't like the earbuds and all the other (besides ""BEATS"") headphones kept falling apart.",681
1036,"Good range, good battery life, great price.",681
1037,These seem like a great buy and well made.,681
1038,I will continue to purchase these headphones whenever they wear out!,681
1039,They are durable and sound great.,681
1040,"I use them mostly in the gym, and signal is strong.",681
1041,The photo is dead on for color.,681
1042,I purchased this for my wife for Christmas.,681
1043,The biggest pro so far is that they are quite comfortable.,681
1044,The band is worn in the back of the neck so it's out of the way and you forget they are even there!,681
1045,"Also, to everyone who buys $200 headphones: ""You got ripped off.""",681
1046,Sound not too bad though but won't recommend for training.,681
1047,The sound quality is nice and it keeps my ears warm in the winter!,681
1048,"This is an Awsome wireless BlueTooth headset, especially for the bargain price.",681
1049,This hurts after a short time.,681
1050,I tried running with it but it just didn't work out for me since it wasn't as snug as a fit as I had wanted.,682
1051,Drowns out the crazies on my morning bus commute.,682
1052,"So basically the warm, good looking, great sounding headphones!",682
1053,I bought these so that my partner did not have to listen to my music.,682
1054,"However, it would be even better of they had the option to connect to devices that do not carry the blue tooth feature.",682
1055,"I originally bought them to wear at the gym, and they work exceptionally well for that.",682
1056,These are still working for me.,682
1057,This is still applicable even during calls.,682
1058,What I really love about them is that I can control my iPhone or Apple watch music functions with the buttons on the side of the ear cover.,682
1059,Great deal for headphones.,682
1060,I got a pair of MDR-NC7 for about what I paid for the MDR-ZX100s I'm reviewing here.,682
1061,"However, after bumping my first song on it, I immediately felt 100% satisfied with my purchase.",682
1062,I would buy them again but my current ones don't look anywhere close to breaking.,682
1063,I highly recommend these to anyone!,682
1064,"I bought these with a skeptical eye, being that I am familiar with Sony products, I was expecting good sound, but these headphones blew me away!",682
1065,Connected easy to 2 different phones.,682
1066,It is very annoying to get rapped in the cord when you are trying to run so I bought these.,682
1067,"I've used the headsets for two straight business days running for 10 hrs straight on both days before I had to recharge the headset, that is excellent.",682
1068,"They have a decent bass sound but it is lacking in that deep rumble, however it does sound very good.",682
1069,I bought these in red at Ross for $15 because they had a discount for them.,682
1070,"So, I don't know how these hold up to active uses.",682
1071,"they are light weight and confortable, but i wish the cord was a little more longer since i use them in the computer at work and is kinda hard to move around with shoert cord...",682
1072,"While they aren't advertised as sweat proof, I have sweated out buckets with these on and have had no effect on usage!",682
1073,"It's possible I just got a bad pair, but I suggest avoiding these anyway.",682
1074,Higher quality and a higher price to match.,682
1075,The fact that the ear pieces rotate so they can store flat is a great feature.,683
1076,They only broke when I accidentialy had them in my pocket while kayaking.,683
1077,Does not feel flimsy at all.,683
1078,"2) They are uncomfortable to wear
3) They look funny when you wear them in public.",683
1079,"I purchased this Bluetooth headset to replace a Sound Bot headset that worked but always seemed clumsy, cheap and looked a bit dorky.",683
1080,"They may not be the best headphones out there, but they are a great deal, and still a good set of headphones.",683
1081,Still very much worth it if you don't mind having no isolation with the music off.,683
1082,Bought them as gifts for directors who were competing at a marching band event and they loved them!!!,683
1083,"They aren't audiophile headphones, but they are more than adequate; moreover, I don't have to switch headsets if I'm in a meeting and then want to drown out the office noise with music after the meeting is over.",683
1084,Super durable I guess.,683
1085,These headphones were exactly what I was looking for.,683
1086,For the price these are a great buy.,683
1087,"My older cousin, who knows a lot about headphones, said these sound better than her $70 headphones.",683
1088,Great product!!,683
1089,The Panasonic RP-HT21 is head and shoulders above the Sony MDRZX100.,683
1090,"It remains to be seen how the collapsible neck piece stands up, but initial build quality seems good.",683
1091,I bought these because my cat was chewing the cords on my expensive in-ear noise-cancelling earphones.,683
1092,"Obviously, they do not have the fit/sound quality of $200 headphones, but at the price point, there is no competition to the BTH240.",683
1093,So definitely satisfied with these so far.,683
1094,"I understand there's instant nostalgia once you realize you're no longer wire bound and your arms are all free and nilly, but trust me read this first.",683
1095,"these are nice, the bluetooth connection and not having to use a wire is nice, but these weren't loud enough for me, I used these in the gym the first day and it didn't block out all the gym noises like with my regular apple ear pods",683
1096,I thought they were going to be one of those crappy headphones that broke after you took it out of the box,683
1097,I feel like a little more width around back might help give a better angle that wouldn't pinch my ears.,683
1098,I don't wear them for more than a couple hours.,683
1099,Phone calls can be a little on/off sometimes---callers can hear me perfectly fine but sometimes their phone calls get a little muffled.,683
1100,"Overall they are, for lack of a better term, balanced.",684
1101,These headphones are bulky and weigh almost twice as much as the S305's.,684
1102,But these are wonders.,684
1103,"Haven't really tested out the battery life or durability yet, but I suspect they will be more than sufficient.",684
1104,"Not bad, was a little leary of buying them since they were so cheap but thought I'd try the out since they are Sony brand.",684
1105,"You can control volume, track, and answer and make phone calls.",684
1106,I can use them for an hour or so without getting tired of them.,684
1107,"I have only had this for about a week and have not used it for music, so I cant speak to that.",684
1108,I saw several people during my travels wearing these headphones so I would guess they are fairly popular.,684
1109,"I love all your other products, but these are big and bulky (I know, you can clearly tell that by the photo) and hurt the shell of my ears.",684
1110,These were a great fit.,684
1111,There are both coach style buses and city style buses on my route and I'm able to hear over both.,684
1112,Owned for over 6 months and still very happy.,684
1113,"The sound is just okay, and I often have problems connecting this to my devices when I have to switch from my desktop to my phone.",684
1114,"They are easy to pair, work well with my Galaxy S4 and I like that you can raise the volume even though the phone volume has topped off.",684
1115,Used them for about 3+ hours today while on the stationary bike and they didn't feel uncomfortable even after.,684
1116,No volume setting for them at all.,684
1117,"For the price of this set, I'd give it my approval.",684
1118,it kinda is even too long for me (im 5'7).,684
1119,The fit is good.,684
1120,Fantastic sound!,684
1121,"I bought them for my son to use in school, but everyone (including my son) wants to use them at home.",684
1122,Bought them as gifts for directors who were competing at a marching band event and they loved them!!!,684
1123,I bought these headphones in hopes that they would look good.,684
1124,these headphones are the best.,684
1125,Sounds are well reproduced with full bass and high trebles.,685
1126,The various control buttons operate with a nice firm 'click' and their positions are easily remembered.,685
1127,"For the price, you can't go wrong really.",685
1128,"They compress my ears too much, and the band presses against my skull behind my ears to the point that I can only wear them for an hour or two before I have to take them off for a while to let my head decompress.",685
1129,I have owned the BTH220 model and have loved them.,685
1130,"Ask them what Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) or steady-state RMS power or MP3 compression is, and usually that's the end of the conversation.",685
1131,"The ONLY complaint I have, which is not enough to knock off a star, is the aesthetics of these.",685
1132,"If you need a step up from earbuds but do they want to spend more money on a sound proof one, this is the one to buy.",685
1133,Great headphones for $15.,685
1134,"Love the no cord aspect, fits great has wonderful sound quality.",685
1135,The headphones themselves are very light and very comfortable on my head but the bad noise coming from the left speaker is always there.,685
1136,The Artic seems better on the bass range.,685
1137,"I like the sound quality, it has good tones and the bass is pretty good too, something that I love to hear in my music.",685
1138,"And for $20, you can't go wrong.",685
1139,The MDRZX100 are going to a trash bin.,685
1140,"as expensive but they are so fine, that you should just buy two.",685
1141,"There is no adjustment for size, like some high-end (and high dollar) phones.",685
1142,"Yes I know they are 15 bucks, but I really expected more given the reviews on Amazon.",685
1143,Folds up neatly for travelling.,685
1144,The sound quality is nice and it keeps my ears warm in the winter!,685
1145,Wondering how long before it breaks but I'm guessing it will really last...hahaha.,685
1146,This is good for slim and medium size people only.,685
1147,The wrap around style is super comfortable and never bounces/falls off.,685
1148,For the price these are a great buy.,685
1149,"Now it's better than new because the cable is longer,  and better quality than the flimsy cable it came with.",685
1150,"the tension of the headphones cannot be adjusted, only the length can be adjusted.",686
1151,I mostly listen to spoken word podcast rather than music.,686
1152,"Could use a little wider volume range, but for the price, it's an AWESOME product!",686
1153,"The playback controls work well in Android, but only work in native apps on Windows Surface, not in web apps.",686
1154,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,686
1155,They are perfect for the gym.,686
1156,"Read the description before you buy it then get it then complain about it not being noise canceling, these weren't made to cancel out noise, just slightly muffle them out.",686
1157,It sound like one of the sides was starting to have distortion in it.,686
1158,These could be really awesome but they just won't stay put.,686
1159,I love them I'm gonna personalize them with jewels and things later this week because they look blah just being so white but that's just me.,686
1160,One extra star because of the reasonable price.,686
1161,Once I heard them I ordered another pair to keep at work.,686
1162,Good quality stereo headphones and very attractively priced!,686
1163,The packaging was opened when I received these headphones.,686
1164,"At this price point/quality, these headphones are unmatched.",686
1165,UPDATE 12 JUN 2015 - My headphones are completely dead now.,686
1166,One thing to be aware of when turning off the power to the headset.,686
1167,I had to purchase a second one because of that.,686
1168,My only complaint... No padding on the headband does start to hurt the top of my head but I will like just glue a strip of phone to the underside and call it good.,686
1169,"They're definitely not the greatest headphones, but the sound quality IS good for the price.",686
1170,"Good sound, fine bass that does not overpower the mids and highs.",686
1171,"Sound:
  Just bought a pair because I left my Alessandro MS-1s at home and am listenning now.",686
1172,I would purchase these again.,686
1173,However they only look good if they are around your neck.,686
1174,One minor minor complaint for both models are the drivers for the bluetooth on computers needed to be updated for the headsets to work.,686
1175,cord is pretty thick for headphones in the price level and good strain relief near the ends that hopefully will give long and trouble free use.,687
1176,"I am about to purchase a black for my boyfriend actually,
because I don't want his hands on mine lol",687
1177,They're just what I was looking for -- though it would be cool if they had a discrete microphone.,687
1178,Didn't stay on my head as well as I would like when weight lifting.,687
1179,The second pair came in the mail worked great for a week.,687
1180,I was cleaning the walls of my house.,687
1181,I even did a side by side comparison to the Beats and very comparable in sound just not as deep of bass as the Beats.,687
1182,"I originally got these headphones in black a few years back with my Zune and only after getting stepped on, did they break.",687
1183,My biggest complaint is that I can't lay down with them on as the headband runs across the back of the head and is very uncomfortable to lie/lay on.,687
1184,"Nice sound, nice fit, easy to use--what more can one want?",687
1185,"They work great, are light, and pair quickly with my Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 tablets.",687
1186,I am overall very impressed with this company.,687
1187,They sit comfortably on your head & ears.,687
1188,"Every pair of ear buds I owned got thrown around, stomped on and used even more than I used these headphones, but ear buds lasted me twice as long.",687
1189,cord does not tangle.,687
1190,They just recently died they no longer turn on.,687
1191,Would definitely recommend in a situation like mine.,687
1192,I bought these for an auditory discrimination program for my son's therapy.,687
1193,MY SON IS 10 AND I WOULDN'T DARE SPEND WHAT BEATS COST FOR HIM YET!!!!,687
1194,"I'm not sure if this is the headphones or the mp3 player I use, but it only works somewhat.",687
1195,The biggest difference between these and the old V 150's is that those were very dark and even more veiled sounding.,687
1196,I would press the wrong button and ignore a call rather than answering it.,687
1197,No volume setting for them at all.,687
1198,"Theyre cheap and they fold small, they come with a pouch, and they sort of work!",687
1199,"For the price, I can't complain.",687
1200,"It's hard to figure out how to fold it up properly, not a big deal.",688
1201,I bought it almost one year ago and have been wearing them to gym and outdoor cycling.,688
1202,There doesn't appear to be a problem with cable charging while in use.,688
1203,It was simple to pair to my smartphone.,688
1204,They are quite light as well.,688
1205,I have had them for a few months.,688
1206,They go in the backpack with lunch box and everything else squished and squashed :-).,688
1207,Blocks some subway noice but i can still hesr the train.,688
1208,"I like the easy connectivity, but what they are lacking is different audio settings.",688
1209,"I actually bought a pair of these a year ago and have gotten a lot of use out of them-- I bring them to work in my bag and wear them on walks, to cut down on background noise, and for motivation boosts.",688
1210,"Arrived in good time, tried it with iPhone voice calls and with my music playlist.",688
1211,Calls are loud and clear and the microphone appears to be really good since everybody says they hear me clearly.,688
1212,I have a somewhat large head and do not find the BTH240 it be tight.,688
1213,Bought these for my kids in school and I didn't want to spend a lot for school supplies.,688
1214,I've had these headphones for over a year and the battery life is still great.,688
1215,WIll deal with again,688
1216,"The sound quality is also a 10, just enough bass.",688
1217,I suppose I was expecting too much at this price range!,688
1218,"Eye Glasses, earbuds,  scarves.",688
1219,They got me on my feet when i first started recording music,688
1220,"When you need to block out the background sounds of dorm life or the city while you're doing your own thing, these headphones do a wonderful job with general noise.",688
1221,I would even pay for it because without it they are useless.,688
1222,"The sound quality is not breathtaking my any means, but I believe a very good value for the price.",688
1223,"They really are ""good enough"" and honestly better than anything else you'll find for under $40.",688
1224,Money well spent!,688
1225,"Before I bought these, I asked myself if these were really worth it, but it was worth it.",689
1226,If they lasted they wouldn't be so bad especially for the price.,689
1227,"I am going to look into investing in another brand, ANY OTHER BRAND.",689
1228,"As you can tell by looking at the photos, there is not any room between the plastic top of the headphones and the headphones themselves.",689
1229,"Plus, the cups themselves are not too big and bulky, so they're very easy to carry around and fit in your backpack.",689
1230,"Sound quality is clear if you don't need any true base, but overall they feel very cheap for Sony Headphones.",689
1231,For this price you can't ask for anything better.,689
1232,"My first pair that I bought years ago stopped holding a charge, so I switched brands.",689
1233,I will just say you should probably get lil more expensive headphones,689
1234,"When pulling the plug from the headphone jack, i have to pinch the rubber casing to prevent it from pulling apart further.",689
1235,(Which is more than I can say for may other brands.),689
1236,"Not too bad for $15-20 and of course not $200 Beats or Bose sounding, but At $20 I also have a pair of Sennheiser HD202s that blow these Sonys out of the water.",689
1237,The distance you can go is pretty good.,689
1238,It is not top of the line but you will not go wrong with purchasing it.,689
1239,"I mainly purchased these headphones for their nice white and black look which matches my HTC phone, their call quality and being able to control music from the heaphones is fantastic.",689
1240,"Even though these $20 headphones aren't it the same league as those, they are amazing for the price point.",689
1241,"I love all your other products, but these are big and bulky (I know, you can clearly tell that by the photo) and hurt the shell of my ears.",689
1242,BUUUUUTTT it does not adjust (guess everyones head is the same size) and the fitting on the ear is small.,689
1243,"As for colors: I mainly don't care, but there is some small utility value in having different colors, to make it easier to keep track of which is charged or which belongs in my gymbag.",689
1244,"The headphones are nice, as displayed... what i didn't love is the foam, i expected it to be somehow better; then that the power button of the headphones is easily misoperated, as i took the headphones in my pocket they powered up accidentally.",689
1245,People mistook them for Beats headphones at first.,689
1246,"It works great for that, as long is it only used for a short period.",689
1247,"Though I am sure over time I may find complications and if I do I will update this; regardless I will still update this in 3 months, 6 months and a year.",689
1248,These were also a gift and my daughter loves them.,689
1249,And plenty of reviewers here swear by their comfort and ability to stay on while exercising.,689
1250,I am a transcriptionist and work 10 hours a day.,690
1251,The sound is about as good as you can expect for $15.,690
1252,"My two biggest issues are that when I am listening to music via my Macbook and open a new browser tab, the music gets completely distorted for 10-15 seconds.",690
1253,"Sound:
+ Mostly full range, loud, crisp and clear in most of the needed range.",690
1254,"It drives me crazy whenever it's visible to me, so I can imagine how annoying it must be for people around me.",690
1255,"Not deep, but decent.",690
1256,They felt very expensive on my ears!,690
1257,"Since these are on-ear headphones and are not noise cancelling, they do not really keep outside noise out, especially if you're on a plane or around noisy people.",690
1258,"Stylish, cheap, and sounds really good.",690
1259,They also fit fine with my glasses on without pinching which is something I was worried about.,690
1260,I have used them all week at the gym and they are the best!,690
1261,These lasted me a good year and half before they gave out on me :( They were amazing for the price and will be sorely missed.,690
1262,should the replacement 240's work I will update my review.,690
1263,"At first I thought this was perhaps my wifi as I was streaming music, but subsequently I tried with music stored locally on my phone and had the same results, so it appears it is indeed the bluetooth connection.",690
1264,I purchased these based on the reviews but ended up very disappointed and returned them.,690
1265,The Amazon product page lists them as circumaural.,690
1266,"Also, it creaks and it doesn't feel like a quality craftsmanship.",690
1267,Four stars includes value/affordability factors.,690
1268,"They are very comfortable and they are Sony, a name brand.",690
1269,And they are good for that.,690
1270,My kids love them.,690
1271,"So far, I don't have any complaints.",690
1272,"I've just been using them for a couple of days so far, but I am very pleased.",690
1273,Awesome BT headphones for a reasonable price.,690
1274,"They fit her perfectly and they were what she wanted (over the ear, cutting out outside noise) with good sound.",690
1275,"The MDR-V300s also have 30mm drivers, but they have a better magnet, which I assume makes a big difference.",691
1276,"- Portability, the BTH240's fold up nicely and slip into the included cloth bag easily.",691
1277,I got his Sony set and I love them.,691
1278,"I will divide and conquer by category:

Sound: The sound is the main thing.",691
1279,For the price a quality product,691
1280,"For the price (less than 15 bucks), the headphones are working well.",691

1284,The range of the headset is amazing.,691
1285,These headphones do the trick.,691
1286,The battery life is out of this world.,691
1287,They fit pretty well around my ear and have no issues with them falling off when lifting weights or running on a treadmill.,691
1288,Connected to most systems.,691
1289,These headphones are great.,691
1290,Headphones will not pair with my computer.,691
1291,I use these with my iPhone.,691
1292,I have a small head and have never really liked ear buds because they make my ears really sore after a short time.,691
1293,While the rest of the gym endures the noise bleed through their earbuds I'm deep in stereo bliss.,691
1294,"I thought it was just me, but both my brother and my mother had the same problem as well.",691
1295,"My first set my daughter broke, my second set my kitten chewed.",691

1305,"I had the older vesion of these headphones and those were lightweight, and suprisingly, built like a tank.",692
1306,I never would of thought that 7 dollars headphones would work so well.,692
1307,The cable is a quite a bit shorter than the 7506s.,692
1308,They are on fashion here in Ecuador and my daughters love them.,692
1309,"The padding for the ears is way too small, and this would seem comfortable to a small child.",692
1310,I purchased these about 4 years ago and they just died.,692
1311,"These wouldn't pair with my Girlfriend's iPhone or iPad, My iPhone or iPad.",692
1312,They do a great job of blocking out external sound.,692
1313,Great price for these headphones.,692
1314,"That means the laptop is either on my coffee table, sofa, or my lap.",692
1315,"They sound better, but still not great..  None of my recent headphone purchases can match my 20 year old, cheap digital headphones, which are starting to fall apart...:(  These do look great, though.",692

1343,I did have some concerns about the comfort of the back neck piece however I do not even feel it most of the time.,693
1344,I used this when I was running.,693
1345,"However 90% of the time, they work and work well.",693
1346,They could even add $2 to the price without ruining the great value of them.,693
1347,BTW its only day 1 so I will follow up with how they hold up in the long run.,693
1348,"If it does, nothing tape can't fix.",693
1349,"It's a little harder to understand people that are talking to you, but you'll hear that they are talking if you're not blasting music.",693
1350,Bluetooth should work within 30 feet.,694
1351,It was worth it to pay a little extra.,694
1352,The quality when using it for phone calls is very poor.,694
1353,sound quality is good and for the price you cant get any better.,694
1354,"I always tell it like it is, the bad along with the good.",694
1355,";) I didn't want to spend a lot on headphones, but I also have some difficulty with headphones making my ears/head hurt (either by poor design or bad acoustics).",694
1356,"For the price, the sounds is awesome and really makes you feel you are right in either the concert or movie theater!",694
1357,"Stop complaining about how cheap headphones aren't the best quality, I think that is supposed to be rather obvious.",694
1358,"Fit, in terms of tightness on the head ( my hat size is 7 1/4 ) is a 6 on a 1 to ten scale.",694
1359,I expected better from Sony.,694
1360,"These headphones are not very good with music sources that don't have bass tone controls, -like your basic computer.",694
1361,"I keep them in the outside pocket of my gym bag and they have not broken, I am a little careful with them because they are slight, but that is better than some bulky heavy monster headphones.",694
1362,No problems at all.,694
1363,"If you actually know anything about sound reproduction, these are great headphones!",694
1364,"I like this style of headphones for running as opposed to earphones, because the earphones fall out when I start running at higher speeds.",694
1365,I had been waiting excitedly to get this item it's cool good reviews what could go wrong?,694
1366,People mistook them for Beats headphones at first.,694
1367,Higher quality and a higher price to match.,694
1368,"It also works if your phone is left in the car while you get gas, etc.",694
1369,The cord is very thick and can take a decent amount of stress so the wires are undamaged.,694
1370,"Thy are not isolate quite well surrounding noise and sound, U can't wear them in noisy street.",694
1371,"The controls are a delight to use, and easy for your fingers to scope out, even though you can't see them.",694
1372,They sound great and the Bluetooth connection rarely cuts out.,694
1373,These headphones are fine for a normal sized person like my little wifey.,694
1374,I use these almost exclusively with my laptop while in my living room.,694
1375,"I just received these in the mail a couple of days ago so I can't write about how long they last or anything like that, but I can say that I absolutely love them especially for the price.",695
1376,"I ordered these headphones for my son, 17 years old, a wrestler.",695
1377,I bought 2 more after I bought the first one.,695
1378,I got these to replace in-ear headphones because I'm prone to ear infections but geez even with the volume turned way up they don't block outside noise at all.,695
1379,They are very easy to pair with an iPad so that I can listen to iTunes or Spotify through my iPad without disturbing my wife.,695
1380,"My feedback isn't on the sound quality, just that the ears pieces are an awkward size and really uncomfortable for me.",695
1381,I find that I don't even realize that I am wearing them.,695
1382,"Compared to the MDR-V100s that I was trying to replace after a speaker went out, this is complete garbage.",695
1383,Controls are simple to operate.,695
1384,So definitely satisfied with these so far.,695
1385,"I'm about to get another pair.....the other two grew legs

Very rugged (they last a long time), no shedding (some earphones do), and I really like the weight and size",695
1386,I mention them only because they are on my wishlist.,695
1387,- Fit my head well (size 7 5/8 hat) and stayed in place while active.,695
1388,If anyone knows where I can buy a cushion over the top of these please contact me chkaczsn@yahoo.com,695
1389,What is there NOT to like??,695
1390,The units fit snuggly behind my ears providing clear listening and comfort.,695
1391,He is absolutely in love with these.,695
1392,Apparently the honeymoon is over.,695
1393,"Even though they wrap around the back of the head, they still stay on through my routine.",695
1394,You won't be disappointed.,695
1395,I've had mine for two years and it's still going strong!,695
1396,"When you consider the cost for the Beats verses the cost for these headphones , it became an easy decision to make

I find these headphones to be more than I would have thought in regards to the sound quality.",695
1397,So with this order we have a set in the living room and now in the bedroom.,695
1398,"They are moderately comfortable, but can get a bit painful when using them for a long period of time.",695
1399,My head is not particular bigger the other people.,695
1400,For the price worth the money.,696
1401,"I even stopped at the computer in the store and read the reviews, thus prompted to go ahead.",696
1402,I don't use a $500 gold cable to connect my vacuum-tube amplifier to my acoustically isolated $10000 speakers.,696
1403,"Though, this is going to vary on a person by person basis",696
1404,These are decent quality.,696
1405,"Well, here we are a year later and one of the speakers doesn't work.",696
1406,"Most importantly though, the price point is great and I can run, lift weights, and shoot hoops in these just fine.",696
1407,"They aren't audiophile headphones, but they are more than adequate; moreover, I don't have to switch headsets if I'm in a meeting and then want to drown out the office noise with music after the meeting is over.",696
1408,I purchased these because I have gotten up from my desk far too many times - completely forgetting I was attached to computer by a headset jack - these certainly solve that problem!,696
1409,Will update this review to let you know what I think.,696
1410,"They are very nice , lightweight, which is what I wanted.",696
1411,She can wait until she is older for the headphones that cost 10 times the price.,696
1412,"To that end, I'll be trying the 66 Audio BTS+ next, to see if they're any better.",696
1413,They just apologize and send another.,696
1414,He is also picky.,696
1415,The headset works as I expected.,696
1416,"The sound quality is good even for on-the-ear style, so that is a redeeming quality.",696
1417,The distance you can go is pretty good.,696
1418,I am very satisfied for the quality of the headphones.,696
1419,I use these almost exclusively with my laptop while in my living room.,696
1420,My only 'con' would be length of the cable.,696
1421,This is my second pair of kinivo blue tooth headphones.,696
1422,"Otherwise, it's a solid pair for the price!",696
1423,I love the kid but I really love those ATH-50's and I'm not willing  to make the sacrifice on this particular subject.,696
1424,These headphones are also very comfortable and felt great on my head.,696
1425,I have been constantly using it for over 10 months now and it still charges as new and has the same sound quality ... !,697
1426,"They are very easy to use, and very easy to pair with devices.",697
1427,"But anyway, SO worth $20.",697
1428,another thing i am a hardcore music lisitner  usually me ears start to buzz when im throu the first 4 hors but with these i could last 8 hors then i had to take them off for 30 min,697
1429,Amazing Headphone.,697
1430,So far so good with these.,697
1431,"This is comfortable, sounds good and has a cord about 4 feet.",697
1432,"Its sturdy and can withstand abuse (tossing it onto the table, for example) and the wires are thicker than your average $5 headphones.",697
1433,Folks that ask me about them are amazed at the low price point in comparison to other models.,697
1434,Sony headphones are pretty good with great sound and fix very well on my head and ears.,697
1435,These are classics.,697
1436,But not anymore!,697
1437,"They work fine for music, but for you tube or vine DO NOT use these they are laggy and uncomfortable to wear.",697
1438,I like these headphones.,697
1439,After the first time I charged up the headset the rubber flap that covers the USB port won't seal closed and flops open a bit.,697
1440,Maybe it's because I wear glasses.,697
1441,I used these mainly for going to the gym.,697
1442,The battery life is amazing after all this time I still get a full 8 hours of talk time.,697
1443,"Gave these as a gift to a friend and received positive feedback as the headphones did not give her a headache as others do (did not squeeze her head as tightly, and fit perfectly).",697
1444,But its nice and durable.,697
1445,The quality of sound for songs and movie is ok with me but I am not expert.,697
1446,Middle range is also fine.,697
1447,"I wasn't about to pay $200 for a pair of Beats for her, these look nice, and work very well for the price.",697
1448,"Overall, great product and worth the cost!",697
1449,"They're definitely not the greatest headphones, but the sound quality IS good for the price.",697
1450,I'll use them 5-8hrs a week then charge them.,698
1451,Extremely affordable for the average worker who just wants to listen to music at work or at home.,698
1452,I bought these to play music for our baby while she's in the womb.,698
1453,>>The covering over the ear-pads has ripped around the inside speaker.,698
1454,Will keep searching for a better one to try.,698
1455,Can't beat the price and quality!,698
1456,"Minor issue hence the 1 star less, may end up being my fault in the end in which I will update this review.",698
1457,For headphones made by Sony this is a great deal.,698
1458,I was amazed by the quality of these headphones.,698
1459,I bought this headset to avoid all the wire tangling troubles with my wired earphones.,698
1460,Just note that isolation is nonexistant on this one.,698
1461,BUUUUUTTT it does not adjust (guess everyones head is the same size) and the fitting on the ear is small.,698
1462,All in all I think it's a great product for the price,698
1463,BUUUUUTTT it does not adjust (guess everyones head is the same size) and the fitting on the ear is small.,698
1464,"I had just lost some pretty good headphones, but I wasn't really interested in an investment.",698
1465,"They are relatively durable, last about a year or so.",698
1466,"The headset has operating controls on the right headphone, on-off, volume, mode/multifunction button and next or repeat selection.",698
1467,"THE PAIR in question even with the mentioned issues, play perfectly fine out of both sides and still sound pretty damn good ...",698
1468,my 5th generation apple headphones actually sound better then these!,698
1469,I think they look stylish...we'll see if they agree.,698
1470,"The only reason I am giving one start less is, I want to know how much battery life is still remaining in the headset, which I can't see.",698
1471,"I had just lost some pretty good headphones, but I wasn't really interested in an investment.",698
1472,"They are great for around the house listening, and as my first bluetooth headphones, they have greatly increased the amount of music and podcasts I listen to arond the house, mostly from my tablet.",698
1473,Higher quality and a higher price to match.,698
1474,"Not sure how to resolve that, at least it connects to my phone without issue.",698
1475,"Once in a while, they'd nip one of my hairs in the joints.",699
1476,"This can happen even if I'm right next to my phone and outdoors, so I'm not sure if that eliminates the Bluetooth and cellular connections as the culprits.",699
1477,"Hopefully with further tweaking, the snugness of the fit and consistency of the audio quality can be improved in future models.",699
1478,Only wish they worked properly and that they felt comfy on my ears.,699
1479,"I'd recommend KOSS Titanium cheapo's instead.. for the same basic price range they are lighter, sound much better and are more comfortable, plus have volume slider... they just don't have the full enclosure for blocking other sounds as much.",699
1480,"You can control volume, track, and answer and make phone calls.",699
1481,Well done Amazon/Sony.,699
1482,Perfect for working out.,699
1483,"They are comfortable, and you can't beat the price.",699
1484,Not suitable for running at all.,699
1485,This headphones are unbeatable for this price.,699
1486,"In conclusion, a great deal (in my opinion), with some nice touches.",699
1487,"They are very easy to use, and very easy to pair with devices.",699
1488,I'd recommend these for any of the these reasons.,699
1489,"They are fine for the price, but I would consider spending more for a better product.",699
1490,They are comfortable and well worth the price.,699
1491,I originally bought this for a friend since we skype a lot.,699
1492,"You would think these would cost more, but they are crazy cheap!",699
1493,I'm only glad that I ended up with black instead of the ugly green ones.,699
1494,"However, for the price and what they are used for...perfection!",699
1495,I'm not a music mixer or anyone with an ear for sound that has specific needs.,699
1496,I'm surprised how bad the sound is.,699
1497,But they get the job done.,699
1498,I either take them off or shift them so that they're hanging on the top part of my ear instead of the part of my ear connected to my head.,699
1499,"Got what I wanted, nuff said.",699
1500,Very happy with this product.,700
1501,"Both our birthdays are coming next month so I thought I'd buy one, check it out and get another one if I like.",700
1502,I really like these!,700
1503,Great sound quality.,700
1504,You'll get distortion at about 80% on your iDevice.,700
1505,"Bought these a few years ago now as my primary pair at work, they're still going strong and do the job.",700
1506,"But for quick easy portable, these are pretty good to be honest.",700
1507,He hasn't complained about it yet Its been over 1 month.,700
1508,Quality Headphones for the money.,700
1509,There doesn't appear to be a problem with cable charging while in use.,700
1510,"I know most people are thinking ""why are you excited about something it's supposed to do"" but believe me, I've had many others that didn't.",700
1511,"The thing I love is that there very durable, My little nephew bash them 2 times with a baseball bat, and not a single scratch!",700
1512,"A note about the cord, It's short.",700
1513,"I wanted a set that was comfortable, since they can be on for hours and also noise reduction.",700
1514,"These are NOT noise-cancelling headphones, of course, but the design features are pretty good for the under-$20 price.",700
1515,These head phone are still over the ear.,700
1516,It hurt my head to wear them for any longer than 10 minutes.,700
1517,I used 22mm stuffed into each earpad.,700
1518,cord is pretty thick for headphones in the price level and good strain relief near the ends that hopefully will give long and trouble free use.,700
1519,Just make sure you don't push it and you'll be fine.,700
1520,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,700
1521,Excellent value!,700
1522,Everthing you liked abou the older version is great accept the newfound bulk.,700
1523,"They are not noise canceling and they don't block much sound out, which is fine unless you are in a noisy environment.",700
1524,"When the opportunity arose, I bought the ZX300 to see if there really was a difference.",700
1525,"can't even return them they, as they are already out of the return policy.",701
1526,Over a month later and it's still there.,701
1527,"The buttons are easily accessible, but they do sit flush with the hardware, so it's a little tough to tell if you're finger's in the right place if you're wearing gloves.",701
1528,I'm a big guy with a big head and neck BUT I had hoped the designers had factored that into their design specs.,701
1529,"Sound is good (not Bose or anything, but I think it is pretty good for listening to Pandora and computer stuff), and they are super confortable.",701
1530,Body is excellent.,701
1531,I just picked up the SONY MDR-ZX100 headphones today and for the small amount I paid I can't believe the big sound I am getting with them.,701
1532,The battery would not hold a charge after just 1 month of usage.,701
1533,"Like I said, I've only used it once, but the one time it was awesome.",701
1534,Haven't needed to charge the battery again yet.,701
1535,"I do experience some extra noise even with corded head phones, my computer may be evil.",701
1536,"I got these a long time ago, like years!",701
1537,"Every pair of ear buds I owned got thrown around, stomped on and used even more than I used these headphones, but ear buds lasted me twice as long.",701
1538,***The huge downfall to these headphones is there is NO OVERHEAD CUSION.,701
1539,"just bought these headphones and they work pretty well, the only little cons of them is the short wire length and they look weird when wearing them.",701
1540,Had these about 3 years and they are still working.,701
1541,Honestly I rather have these than spend 200$ on a pair of beats when sound quality is superior for the price.,701
1542,But they get the job done.,701
1543,"I told him i had got these Sony headphones your tablet, when plugged the headphones into his tablet  only 1 speaker would sound  (the left side only).",701
1544,The only reason I bought these headphones was because I'm a broke college student who couldn't stand the soupcan sound of the iPhone earbuds anymore.,701
1545,Only alternative was to send them back.,701
1546,In case your wondering in those three years the sound is the same (This time I bough the Black Colored Version) so there is no downgrade in the quality that at times happens.,701
1547,I would highly recommend these headphones without any reservations.,701
1548,This product works fantastic.,701
1549,"Overall they are, for lack of a better term, balanced.",701
1550,I darn near consider em a wannabe beats headset.,702
1551,Decent bass response.,702
1552,Mediocre product and performance.,702
1553,"Despite the sound and price, I don't recommend these headphones, due mostly on the design issues.",702
1554,Would purchase again without hesitation!,702
1555,All in all I highly recommend.,702
1556,The sound was better than the prvious model but they were a bit tighter of a fit.,702
1557,Seem to eliminate background noise somewhat as well as people can still understand me when I'm out walking around my plant.,702
1558,The only problem is they should use a better quality covering over the foam ear muffs.,702
1559,I've been using this to listen to movies I watch on Netflix on my nook.,702
1560,If you don't plan on laying down in these you will not have any problems.,702
1561,"I have a large head, and it fits me really well.",702
1562,"They feel light weight and easily breakable so we've been treating these delicately, but they work great and totally tune out background noise.",702
1563,These have about the same quality as Apple earbuds.,702
1564,Being able to hear in both ears is a great experience.,702
1565,these headphones are the best.,702
1566,I would have returned it but due to my own fault I purchased them and didn't open the box until after the return window was closed.,702
1567,"They were ready to test right out of the box, and connected very easily to my phone and laptop.",702
1568,I'm listening to them now and they have very good sound with good base.,702
1569,Bought two of them and they work great.,702
1570,"She wanted to buy some new headphones with her birthday money, so I told her no more than $20.",702
1571,"Too bad, they're nice headphones otherwise.",702
1572,Very decent headphones for the price!,702
1573,The sound was better than the prvious model but they were a bit tighter of a fit.,702
1574,I bought these a long time ago and let me first say that these last.,702
1575,guess i'll be returning these Sony ones and forking up the extra $30 bucks for another pair of Sennheisers.,703
1576,But my apple earbuds have lasted much longer than that.,703
1577,The Kinivo BTH240 is my 3rd pair of bluetooth stereo headphones.,703
1578,"To my surprise, they sounded pretty good for $15.",703
1579,"It works great for that, as long is it only used for a short period.",703
1580,They needed charging & so I charged it to full battery & they worked for an hour after turning them on & faded out.,703
1581,I have no idea whether any of that is due to the headset or the cell phone I'm using.,703
1582,There is no padding on them.,703
1583,Love these and would purchase again.,703
1584,I've love the way this headset works with my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.,703
1585,"The only things I would note are that they feel a bit flimsy and the ""sony"" logo wore off the side within a week.",703
1586,"Cons: not really loud, its plastic, Earcups aren't really comfortable",703
1587,It isn't surround-sound quality.,703
1588,It is very annoying to get rapped in the cord when you are trying to run so I bought these.,703
1589,I will give these headphones 5 stars based on price.,703
1590,But then I started hearing jumbled voices on a few of my calls and I doubled checked - it wasn't the internet connection.,703
1591,Bought these for quiet netflix watching and song listening on my chrome book and these definitely do the trick.,703
1592,Husband loves them really good working.,703
1593,But they are really a no go because they're just so uncomfortable to wear!,703
1594,"These always hurt the top of my head, even after I take them off!",703
1595,The volume and skip track buttons give off a loud click when depressed; that click is amplified right next to the ear.,703
1596,"Only good for small digital devices, which is why I bought them.",703
1597,It remembers the last 5 devices you paired with so once I have paired with all of my devices it will be a piece of cake to pair.,703
1598,It's so damn uncomfortable.,703
1599,The sound is not that great but it matches many of 30 dlls headphones,703
1600,Sound escapes it - terrible for discreet listening/listening to something loud in quiet places.,704
1601,I like the way you can easily fold them to make them fit in your backpack or in a pouch for protection.,704
1602,"Once your headphones and device are connected, they're basically ready.",704
1603,Perfect for working out.,704
1604,"Out of the box, quick connection to the phone and up for HOURS of great music.",704
1605,I'm using it right now and have been the last 4 hours... still no feed me beep and I still haven't charged it....it's awesome.,704
1606,"Overall: decent headphones, obviously they're $15 so they're not great, but they do good enough.",704
1607,I love the sound these have and they are almost as good as what I had with the Walkman that I purchased almost 2 years ago.,704
1608,These headphones are amazing.,704
1609,"Obviously, they do not have the fit/sound quality of $200 headphones, but at the price point, there is no competition to the BTH240.",704
1610,"I guess I had higher expectations for these headphones, but a regular old pair of ear buds that you would think were lower quality lasted me longer.",704
1611,One star only because there's no negative.,704
1612,I was skeptical getting these as I'm coming from having Rocket Fish bluetooth headphones.,704
1613,Other than that one small thing so far all is great they wear good and sound good!,704
1614,Highly recommend.,704
1615,All in all I highly recommend.,704
1616,"Normal use for it is something like ""Hardball,"" but last night I listened to a blues online radio site and the thing delivered spot-on sound.",704
1617,Always go Sony.,704
1618,They've got no high end at all.,704
1619,"They looked all right during the purchase, but after receiving it and actually wearing it to and from the gym, I have to honestly say they're not the coolest of things.",704
1620,"Just recently the plug does not stay in all the way in the headphone jack of either my iPad Mini, my Lenovo Tablet, or the TV.",704
1621,They stay in place while running and can get loud enough to block out surrounding noise.,704
1622,"I received these on time and have only had them a few days, but they have worked great.",704
1623,"The noise cancellation was much better than I thought it would be, so definite props for that on low price headphones.",704
1624,"They looked all right during the purchase, but after receiving it and actually wearing it to and from the gym, I have to honestly say they're not the coolest of things.",704
1625,In my opinion these are so much better than the crap beats by dre.,705
1626,"But for the price, I think that these are way more than worth it if you need a cheap pair of headphones that will last you longer than twinkies in the post nuclear world.",705
1627,"One minor irritation is that the back of the headphone, that is, the plastic link between the earpieces, gets in the way, if I am leaning on my sofa or lying down,  If that part could be made thinner and adjustable, it would be a five star product",705
1628,"When I listen to all my favorite song's the  sound's on this Sony stereo headphone's are great you can hear the music more,it tune's out any other sound around you.",705
1629,They also fit fine with my glasses on without pinching which is something I was worried about.,705
1630,I love them I'm gonna personalize them with jewels and things later this week because they look blah just being so white but that's just me.,705
1631,Can't wait to go full force in the gym with these.,705
1632,"Takes a bit to adjust to control location(skipped a few songs,dropped a few calls,but great product for the price",705
1633,The head set is incredibly comfy and folds up very nicely.,705
1634,For $30 you cannot complain though.,705
1635,I look forward to Kinivo's next model.,705
1636,"Note that these are the sports-type of headphones, and instead of going over the top of the head, they go behind the neck.",705
1637,"The controls are a delight to use, and easy for your fingers to scope out, even though you can't see them.",705
1638,"Chord is long too, and really good to use this on the treadmill.",705
1639,The headset is overall a good pair of headphones.,705
1640,It's neither good or bad.,705
1641,"I honestly got these as a secondary pair, when I don't feel like using or lending anyone my Bose.",705
1642,"To me, the bass on these is perfect.",705
1643,Had these about 3 years and they are still working.,705
1644,I like to listen while cleaning house.,705
1645,It's not very comfortable either.,705
1646,Microphone works well and can even be used with Siri.,705
1647,"Any movement of my head, and the phones slip off and become annoyingly uncomfortable in a hurry.",705
1648,"So far, I don't have any complaints.",705
1649,these are great and a great price.,705
1650,"I guess I had higher expectations for these headphones, but a regular old pair of ear buds that you would think were lower quality lasted me longer.",706
1651,"I can actually hear the bass of my music thrumming now and have found myself getting startled occasionally, even, as they pick up softer sounds in the background of my music that I had not previously heard.",706
1652,"Oh, my previous 3 pairs that this beats:
Skullcandy Hesh
Skullcandy Inked
Panasonic RP-HTX7PP (Although very very very close.",706
1653,I would have to say that my one complaint is that the cords tangle and twist so it is hard to be comfortable.,706
1654,These would definitely be that product.,706
1655,"If you have a head larger than a 5 year old kid, buy something else!!!",706
1656,"This was a gift to a friend, but I also have a black one and I use it everyday.",706
1657,Perhaps this product is not designed to be paired with more than one item at a time.,706
1658,"Constantly skips, or disconnects and refuses to reconnect to my computer.",706
1659,Sounds good for the modest price.,706
1660,These could be really awesome but they just won't stay put.,706
1661,I'm surprised how bad the sound is.,706
1662,"Clear sounds, lightweight, easy to wear.",706
1663,Also style is beautiful.,706
1664,"I have enough slack to wear these headphones comfortably, but once in a while they get yanked off.",706
1665,"For headphones that cost $14, Sony's WDRZX100 Outdoor Headphones are solid.",706
1666,Does not feel flimsy at all.,706
1667,Best headphones I've ever had and so inexpensive.,706
1668,"So far I'm not having any problems with one-side going out, no strange noises.",706
1669,I don't use them every day but I have had these for 2 years almost and they are going strong.,706
1670,They have a soft rubber cover over where the wire meets the male connector (i.e.,706
1671,If one side just had a nub or braille I'd have a much easier time making sure they were on the right way (and this would also make them friendly for the blind).,706
1672,5) No clicking sound from the buttons as reported by other users.,706
1673,So the new three star rating is for the company not the headset that gets a two tops.,706
1674,They have been great!,706
1675,- They're adjustable.,707
1676,Not tight fitting at all and would fall of if you have to bend down quickly to pick something up.,707
1677,"For headphones that cost $14, Sony's WDRZX100 Outdoor Headphones are solid.",707
1678,He said the sound was great compared to most sets he's had.,707
1679,"They are comfortable, block out outside noise, and have good audio quality.",707
1680,"Honestly, spend a little more money and get a nicer pair of headphones.",707
1681,And the finishing BEST feature of these is the price.,707
1682,They sat for another 6 months until I got around to fixing them.,707
1683,"The sound is not great, although not terrible either.",707
1684,I bought this back in 2014 for school and just to relax with.,707
1685,"Still these are ten bucks, no way these can compete with more expensive headphones.",707
1686,"Reveals unknown facts of the sex, drugs, and rock and roll, also includes a very personal account of Ann's struggle with her weight.",707
1687,"We haven't opened yet as they are for a christmas present, but have purchased similar before.",707
1688,"When I first put them on I had concerns about comfort, but they are quite comfortable for extended wear.",707
1689,Battery life is good.,707
1690,"You can feel the weight when you first put it on, depending how you run or work out it could jiggle around but the sound is great, I can hear the base and keep the beat while on the spin bike.",707
1691,"For that reason, and for the fact that I wanted a better sound experience, I got on the hunt for good headphones.",707
1692,"Within 5 seconds use could see there is a very noticeable lag in audio and what the video is doing, a second or two delay.",707
1693,"But if you want to spend some where under $30, might want to give these a try.",707
1694,"All I can say they are better than the more expensive phones I bought elsewhere on line that were called the deal of the day
Update: thin material on the foam earphones flakes off little by little leaving white speckles on your ears.",707
1695,"If you are not serious audiophile, you'll be reasonably happy.",707
1696,These are more comfortable and have better sound quality.,707
1697,Don't waste your money on such a cheap piece of crap.,707
1698,"These head phones are good quality, you can hear clearly.",707
1699,Definitely a bargain.,707
1700,No volume setting for them at all.,708
1701,"that I woke someone up by calling them at a bad hour, I knew these were unacceptable.",708
1702,it kinda is even too long for me (im 5'7).,708
1703,Wont be disappointed it gets the job done.,708
1704,The small carrying bag is a plus and thank you for including the USB charging cable.,708
1705,"Its sturdy and can withstand abuse (tossing it onto the table, for example) and the wires are thicker than your average $5 headphones.",708
1706,"They made it all the way to Friday afternoon again... My previous headphones would last two days and crashed & burned permanently after a hard workout...
Definitely will buy again if the ones I have ever fail!!",708
1707,I really like it for listening functions.,708
1708,Seem ambient enough.,708
1709,I love the way it sounds and feels.,708
1710,The headphone's sound is clear and flat in the mid range and part of the high frequency range.,708
1711,I've also recommended them to several at the office for conference calls on the laptops.,708
1712,"(walls being in the way seem to be the biggest issue...)

overall, i'd recommend these to anyone looking for a round-the-back style bluetooth headset.",708
1713,The cord length is good.,708
1714,Easy to set up and control.,708
1715,Fantastic sound!,708

1717,I have recommended this product to several people.,708
1718,I bought one for work then I bought another for home.,708
1719,"Easy to wear (not uncomfortable), stay on my ears when i need them to, not much else to say.",708
1720,one word amazing!!,708
1721,I bought these a long time ago and let me first say that these last.,708
1722,I will say that they are comfortable but as for connectivity it's not so good.,708
1723,I have yet to run out of battery before a recharge.,708
1724,"My complaints are mostly about how they are built:  The cord is extremely short, even shorter than the MDR-V150, and it's taking some getting used to.",708
1725,"I had been searching for days upon days for a headphone, but being the penny pincher that I am I finally found these headphones.",709
1726,I've also put it in many bags when traveling where I'm sure the cords were angled in a way that should have caused fraying but the cords are fine.,709
1727,This is a terrible headphone!!!,709
1728,I purchased these based on the reviews but ended up very disappointed and returned them.,709
1729,I would NOT recommend these for purchase from anywhere.,709
1730,I would turn my music up and the music just sounded like it needed to be louder with the headphones and they werent.,709
1731,I am using it with my nano touch.,709
1732,This was my ideal situation!,709
1733,"Unfortunatley, the design for staying on the head is not very good.",709
1734,"For most people, they'll sound great for just $15, especially if your device/program has an adjustable EQ.",709
1735,But if your like me then I bet you will be satisfied with the average quality.,709
1736,Those without such issues or not looking for any noise blocking qualities will love these headphones.,709
1737,So they work best when you only pair them to one device and are very careful not to push the wrong buttons.,709
1738,They addressed my issue immediately and issued a refund.,709
1739,Build quality is decent.,709
1740,"Thy are not isolate quite well surrounding noise and sound, U can't wear them in noisy street.",709
1741,It needs charging probably once or twice a week with regular use.,709
1742,Connected easy to 2 different phones.,709
1743,These are just what I wanted.,709
1744,"I wish they had a better grip though, as in a month they started to fall down if I picked something up.",709
1745,My original pair of BTH240's were great.,709
1746,For $25 bucks they're damn good.,709
1747,I was so excited to try these out considering all the positive reviews.,709
1748,i walk around w/o iphone in my hand in the house and it still sound great.,709
1749,"The battery life is excellent, I've never had the battery run down on me.",709
1750,This was even better then the original one I had .,710
1751,Both headphones are about the same sound wise.,710
1752,I finally got it to sync.,710
1753,These are classics.,710
1754,"Great set of headphones,I bought these for my shortwave radio.",710
1755,My previous pair lasted over two years while being used daily by my two boys ages 16 and 10.,710
1756,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,710
1757,They bluetooth well and do just what they say.,710
1758,Especially for those looking for a set of headphones to be used while exercising or running.,710
1759,This headphone isolates just enough sound for me to enjoy the music while letting some sound in which is essential for safety.,710
1760,This pair must have a short it never stays connected it beeps all day long going in and out.,710
1761,Very happy with this purchase.,710
1762,I remember how much I loved the first pair I bought so I decided to purchase them again to compliment my droid incredible.,710
1763,"I do clean them every so often, so I don't know if it's just that they are dirty and making my skin itch, or if I am having an allergic reaction to the material.",710
1764,Would purchase again.,710
1765,"sound is OK. the best use is for working out at the gym, and you don't have to use the loaners they have there.",710
1766,That's what the money buys and no more.,710
1767,If anything ever happens to them we will definitely be repurchasing!,710
1768,I'm listening to them now and they have very good sound with good base.,710
1769,He states that the quality of sound is very good coming from the headphones and I tried them as well and I actually like them a lot better than my J Lab in ear headphones.,710
1770,"Other than that, regardless of how I have it on, it fits well enough that I can't complain.",710
1771,Normally cheap headphones are tinny and junky sounding but these really sound good.,710
1772,"It doesn't like the below temps, but it seems like it doesn't affect it... yet.",710
1773,Definitely not a phone issue as I tried it with several other devices.,710
1774,Main reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is they can feel loose at times if I am doing more intense workouts.,710
1775,If I move my head up or down it moves the earpieces.,711
1776,"They are relatively durable, last about a year or so.",711
1777,They are perfect for the gym.,711
1778,Amazon made it easy for me though.,711
1779,"Normally I'm not one to write negative reviews, but yikes, I'm pretty dissatisfied with these headphones, even for the $20 I paid.",711
1780,"That means the laptop is either on my coffee table, sofa, or my lap.",711
1781,"I guess I had higher expectations for these headphones, but a regular old pair of ear buds that you would think were lower quality lasted me longer.",711
1782,"I do experience some extra noise even with corded head phones, my computer may be evil.",711
1783,I suggest getting a warranty.,711
1784,I have had mine for about two years and they are in perfect quality.,711
1785,The sound quality was horrible and I hated having them in my ear.,711
1786,Folks that ask me about them are amazed at the low price point in comparison to other models.,711
1787,"They are compatible with every music/sound device that I own like my laptop, phone, mp3 player and radio.",711
1788,This is certainly the case here as well.,711
1789,It isn't that bad unless you want the music blasting your ears off in which these won't do.,711
1790,It was bound to happen one day but I was expecting a longer life time from the rest of these reviews.,711
1791,"The portion that wraps around your ear can get a little sore and annoying after a while, but just a little adjusting and it will go away.",711
1792,Haven't had anyone complain that they can't hear me while talking to them on it.,711
1793,The phone is ok. Not the best mic but for the money they are worth it.,711
1794,"I had high hopes, but this just didn't get me there.",711
1795,It's a good set of headphones for the price.,711
1796,"Good range, love not being tethered to my phone, and can still listen to my music from two rooms away.",711
1797,My kiddo is tough on head phones.,711
1798,"While not a Bose or those other HD headphones for the price range, I don't think you'll see much better value.",711
1799,"Most importantly, the Kinivo earphones are comfortable for me while exercising.",711
1800,They paired with my iPod and my Galaxy 3 Droid phone effortlessly.,712
1801,"For $10-15, these are great.",712
1802,Bought this product after seeing high reviews !!,712
1803,I listen to mostly podcasts.,712
1804,"It's not as long as my last set of headphones, which would probably be good for someone using them for anything other than what I use them for, which is sitting at my computer.",712
1805,8.5/10 - Bass heavy and get uncomfortable,712
1806,I road my bike around the neighborhood with them on and they shifted alot and I just couldn't get them to sit comfortably on my BIG head,712
1807,I would press the wrong button and ignore a call rather than answering it.,712
1808,Got for my boys for Christmas.,712
1809,"Gave to my 12 year old grandson and he was so very excited, spent the rest of Christmas vacation with them on his head listening to music almost all the time.",712
1810,Don't think it's possible to find anything better for this price.,712
1811,"The white ones are nice in appearance and I liked the red stripe on the right hand side, which makes knowing which side is which very easy at a glance.",712
1812,I am considering a second pair so I won't have to share.,712
1813,"This model is replacing the better quality, better sounding MDR-V150 model.",712
1814,A really great buy!,712
1815,So far I really like them.,712
1816,"I love all your other products, but these are big and bulky (I know, you can clearly tell that by the photo) and hurt the shell of my ears.",712
1817,Got the headphones for my son as throw aways because he is very hard on headsets.,712
1818,They are so convenient for when he is working he can listen to his music and answer phone calls with just one click without having to take out his phone and answer the call or change songs!,712
1819,"Too bad, they're nice headphones otherwise.",712
1820,"Overall, I'm happy with them, particularly at the $15.99 price point.",712
1821,Battery life is good.,712
1822,I let people listen and now 3 other people have bought them.,712
1823,They sound significantly worse than the $20 store-bought Sony headphones I'd been using.,712
1824,I've also recommended them to several at the office for conference calls on the laptops.,712
1825,"It's tolerable and does not cause a major issue, it's just a minor noticeable thing.",713
1826,Great bass sound.,713
1827,"Stop complaining about how cheap headphones aren't the best quality, I think that is supposed to be rather obvious.",713
1828,They paired with my iPod and my Galaxy 3 Droid phone effortlessly.,713
1829,I have not got to the end of the battery yet and I pretty much use it all day long so it has great battery life.,713
1830,I've had them for about 8 workouts now and they've been great!,713
1831,I own a pair I bought two years ago in-store.,713
1832,"impressive range and sound...paired, worked easily out of the box.",713
1833,I also like how the ear piece swivels to make a much more comfortable fit.,713
1834,"When I first put them on I had concerns about comfort, but they are quite comfortable for extended wear.",713
1835,The first generation headphones worked amazing for almost 18 months before the power port rusted out from sweat.,713
1836,"Now, on a regular basis, I use these headphones for just listening to music walking down the street from my ipod.",713
1837,These are almost too good to be true.,713
1838,so we got another 2 pairs one for each kid and in different colors.,713
1839,I just want to upgrade.,713
1840,They replaced a large pair of highly rated Photive over the ear Bluetooth phones (which broke) at half the price.,713
1841,Pretty good sound.,713
1842,"If you're looking for cheap headphones with potentially great sound quality, you've found them.",713
1843,"Clear sounds, lightweight, easy to wear.",713
1844,Perhaps this product is not designed to be paired with more than one item at a time.,713
1845,Battery last a lot too!,713
1846,"Let me tell you, these things can take a beating.",713
1847,These headphones can get pretty loud too.,713
1848,I am returning them and buying a new pair once more hopefully these will not cut in and out.,713
1849,I'm not concerned about them falling off.,713
1850,It's a good set of headphones for the price.,714
1851,I was tired of having to worry about my headphone cords getting caught under something.,714
1852,"Second, they were packaged well and arrived with no damage.",714
1853,";-) )
They are also very comfy.",714
1854,"They are small, really small.",714
1855,"Use for exercise: Stays on while I am walking on a treadmill or elliptical, but not running.",714
1856,Music fidelity and bass sounds better than previous wired headsets.,714
1857,I'd recommend these for any of the these reasons.,714
1858,"I have spent the past few months looking for a cheap bluetooth option because when the family is at home, and I'm on the treadmill watching whatever on the TV, I can listen to it without disturbing them.",714
1859,"For $15, these are probably some of the best sounding headphones you can buy.",714
1860,They are comfortable.,714
1861,These headphones have great sound and cost less.,714
1862,I bought one for work then I bought another for home.,714
1863,I've had a pair of these and used them every single day for the past 4 years at work.,714
1864,"Not that I was using them... oh, which brings up another good point!",714
1865,"They definitely get the job done and for the price, there really isn't any complaint I could make.",714
1866,"You would think these would cost more, but they are crazy cheap!",714
1867,"For that reason, and for the fact that I wanted a better sound experience, I got on the hunt for good headphones.",714
1868,"I know most people are thinking ""why are you excited about something it's supposed to do"" but believe me, I've had many others that didn't.",714
1869,The headset came nicely packaged and there was a USB charging cable provided.,714
1870,Not sure how long they will last as they feel flimsy;time will tell.,714
1871,We already had red ones so we knew they were great headphones.,714
1872,"But for quick easy portable, these are pretty good to be honest.",714
1873,"they are simple yet elegent, they have a outstanding base, and are incredebly comfortable.",714
1874,You just pop these on your head and you forget it.,714
1875,"So, my solution was to get wireless headphones.",715
1876,"Nope, they're pretty comfortable, and I've rarely found headphone I didn't hate, I have a rather large head and imagine they'd be super comfortable on most people.",715
1877,"So I sleep in these things, I stand up forgetting their on and yank the cord hard.. it gets stepped on sat on twisted... water all over them.",715
1878,"(If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking ""yes"" at the end of my review!)",715
1879,Not sure if this is a wake up call or a warning or something.,715
1880,My kiddo is tough on head phones.,715
1881,"My main issue is that they keep cutting out, like multiple times in the length of a single song.",715
1882,"It isn't much weight, though.",715
1883,I purchased several different brands of headphones for my 5 year old to use at computer class at school but they kept breaking.,715
1884,She can wait until she is older for the headphones that cost 10 times the price.,715
1885,Cons: the plastic that goes around the ear and behind the head is hard and does not flex.,715
1886,Save your money and get a different product.,715
1887,"For the asking price, these are excellent quality and a fantastic value.",715
1888,I have been wanting bluetooth headphones for my computer but didn't know how they worked.,715
1889,They have met all my expectations...,715
1890,":)

My little guy likes them also!",715
1891,Until one side of the headphones stopped working.,715
1892,"Overall, I highly recommend them for the average listener, but not for the audiophile snob types.",715
1893,I am also very happy with Kinivo's customer service.,715
1894,but once i put them on i realized they had amazing quality.,715
1895,I need a ponytail in place to hold the headband up so that it doesn't drift down.,715
1896,I use it for running and walking.,715
1897,I didn't think the fit was right for me.,715
1898,Great phones!!!,715
1899,"Probably needless to say, the Bose OE2 lightweight headphones, also top rated by Consumer Reports, sound the best.",715
1900,I use them on my daily walk.,716
1901,"Because of this, this is something that's a must and these are not very loud.",716
1902,use them every day.,716
1903,They actually provide a decent sound dampening from any outside noise even though they are not noise cancelling.,716
1904,"Since it just sits on your ears, however, sound will leak if the volume is on really really high.",716
1905,Your guess is as good as mine!,716
1906,The only reason I bought these headphones was because I'm a broke college student who couldn't stand the soupcan sound of the iPhone earbuds anymore.,716

1908,Clear sound and good microphone.,716
1909,I wanted to experiment with bluetooth headphones and these were a solid but low cost way to try them out.,716

1911,My previous pair lasted over two years while being used daily by my two boys ages 16 and 10.,716
1912,"As far as battery life, I've not had to charge them yet.",716
1913,Decent bass response.,716
1914,"However, this was likely because of how use to my *awesome* Apple earbuds i was.",716
1915,"I'm partial to over-the-ear headphones, never could get used to uncomfortable earbuds.",716
1916,I purchased these headphones after my daughter broke her pair on Christmas day.,716
1917,"I even stopped at the computer in the store and read the reviews, thus prompted to go ahead.",716
1918,They feel cheap but you what you pay for.,716
1919,I love these things.,716
1920,These broke after about 2 months of use.,716
1921,"Contrary to other reviewers, I did not find them to be so comfortable for long periods.",716
1922,I honestly would have returned it but was too lazy.,716
1923,Would definitely recommend in a situation like mine.,716
1924,I must say my head is all of 71/2 in.,716
1925,$15 for over the ear headphones is a good price.,717
1926,The first pair are about 2 years old and still going strong.,717
1927,"In addition, they are bulky and don't allow for leaning on anything.",717
1928,I don't use them every day but I have had these for 2 years almost and they are going strong.,717
1929,"However, for the price and what they are used for...perfection!",717
1930,Great headphones and a great price.,717
1931,"Really good for my four year old, ladted 6 monthes, for the price vs. abuse it was a great deal.",717

1933,Haven't had anyone complain that they can't hear me while talking to them on it.,717
1934,The wires are so tiny and thin that they easily get damaged.,717
1935,"The combo sounds clear, lows are present but not pronounced some what tinney but I wasn't expecting a high end product so it's good for a quick fix or road trip, get them at walmart  $30.00.",717
1936,"For less than 20 dollars, SONY is SONY.",717
1937,There was nothing misleading in the description - I think it states 47 1/2 inches and this is accurate.,717
1938,I've been through many bluetooth headphones and these are at the top of the list.,717
1939,Headphones fit my head.,717
1940,"I was hoping for a headset to listen to music while I do manual work and chores, but it provides so little protection from outside noise that it's nearly useless for that.",717
1941,"I'd recommend KOSS Titanium cheapo's instead.. for the same basic price range they are lighter, sound much better and are more comfortable, plus have volume slider... they just don't have the full enclosure for blocking other sounds as much.",717
1942,"Despite the sound and price, I don't recommend these headphones, due mostly on the design issues.",717
1943,These are great headphones that block out outside noise and you need not turn the volume up to hear things clearly.,717
1944,"unfortunately, they are a little too flimsy for my taste and it  took me a while to use them.",717
1945,I'd recommend these for anyone looking for a solid pair of bluetooth headphones thats always on the go.,717
1946,"The rigid behind the head bar is just a skotch too small, the phones might fall off if I move carelessly.",717
1947,Sent them back thinking that they were a dud and ordered a replacement.,717
1948,"Then one day when I was trying to charge it, the red light turned on for 30 seconds or so and turned off right away.",717
1949,"""I listen to my radio at a reasonable volume.""",717
1950,Better volume and overall fit and finish than prior model.,718

1952,Had these about 3 years and they are still working.,718
1953,Gone are the days you can buy a well made pair of headphones or ear-buds for a decent price that will last.,718
1954,Now the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone I have are worthless.,718
1955,I would always wear my cord under my shirt to minimize the snagging which works alright until I start sweating.,718
1956,"I use both BOSE at home, and this product when I travel.",718
1957,I gave these only 4 stars simply because I don't have any high-end sets to compare them with.,718
1958,"They are not noise canceling and they don't block much sound out, which is fine unless you are in a noisy environment.",718
1959,I really like it for listening functions.,718
1960,"I'm considering the price range, I did not expect it to sound as good as a sennheiser but still it was a bit disappointing",718
1961,"Our son who has Autism uses them daily, the last pair lasted 6+ years before the outer cover of the ear pads started to wear off.",718
1962,These headphones were inexpensive and arrived fairly quickly.,718
1963,Best headphone I've ever used.,718
1964,"I keep them in the outside pocket of my gym bag and they have not broken, I am a little careful with them because they are slight, but that is better than some bulky heavy monster headphones.",718
1965,"I finally gave these to my granddaughter, I don't think she uses them, hers had mickey mouse or something on them making even them better than bth240 headphones.",718
1966,These head phones have worked like charm.,718
1967,They've got no high end at all.,718
1968,"After a time, they do become a bit uncomfortable due to the tighter squeeze than an over the head style of headphones involve.",718
1969,My kiddo is tough on head phones.,718
1970,"The ear cushions are small and barely covers my ears, and I have small ears.",718
1971,"The ones I had were actually Sony, and more expensive than these headphones!!!!",718
1972,I run treadmills and rid trains with this and can't care about anyone else's opinion about the brand because they don't know what perfection I'm listening to.,718
1973,then you'll be fine.,718
1974,These headphones have good sound and nice quality for the price.,718
1975,I'm surprised how bad the sound is.,719
1976,The Panasonic RP-HT21 is head and shoulders above the Sony MDRZX100.,719

1978,I wanted to replace the USB Microsoft LifeChat I use with Bluetooth headphones.,719
1979,I bought the Photive BTH3 instead and wish I hadn't wasted my time these headphones.,719
1980,My son also eecieved Beats headphones for Christmas and prefers these..,719
1981,Very light and folds up for travel.,719
1982,"However, it would be even better of they had the option to connect to devices that do not carry the blue tooth feature.",719
1983,"Artic has a large LED, on/off light you can't miss.",719
1984,Middle range is also fine.,719
1985,"So, if you need a pair of ""Headphones"" but you ""Ain't got a lot of money"", then check these out!!",719
1986,After this experience I decided to purchase another pair of 220's which I also enjoyed very much before my original pair failed.,719
1987,So I rate 4 stars.,719
1988,Bought these specifically to use with my Dish Network Hopper.,719
1989,Before buying them I was a little hesitant based on reviews from other users on amazon.,719
1990,- The good thing with these is these will work with both cell phones and PC's.,719
1991,"Overall, they were a great value, no complaints about the sound.",719
1992,I wasn't expecting  the sound to be so crisp and clear.,719

1996,I thank the many other users for the great reviews that brought me to this purchase.,719
1997,I like the fact that I can lay the ear muff flat so I can just slip it my computer case.,719

2000,People mistake it from dre.,720
2001,He thought he'd never find one like it.,720

2003,"They would no longer hold a charge so I upgraded to this model, the BTH240.",720
2004,Good quality headphones.,720
2005,Honestly I rather have these than spend 200$ on a pair of beats when sound quality is superior for the price.,720
2006,"Even with these nitpicks, I still give these 5/5 stars.",720
2007,The sound is very good.,720
2008,But when i buy this sony for remplace mines this was a big mistake!!!,720

2014,MUSIC / CALL AUDIO QUALITY : The sound quality is very much acceptable considering the price you pay for this.,720
2015,Still very much worth it if you don't mind having no isolation with the music off.,720
2016,"Things with lots of bass (movies, dance music) have good punch.",720
2017,"The 240 has improved control options, but oddly less range for higher volume?",720

2019,The ear cups are a little small for me.,720
2020,"The over the ear design works better than ear buds, which tend to fall out of their little ears.",720
2021,"Obviously, they do not have the fit/sound quality of $200 headphones, but at the price point, there is no competition to the BTH240.",720
2022,"I'm not sure whether if the sound had to do with the apple products, but both the Sony headphones, and my old generic $10.00  store bought headphones produced the same sound.",720
2023,"As far as battery life, I've not had to charge them yet.",720

2063,For the price paid these are decent headphones.,722

2067,"No, I don't have a huge head.",722

2116,"As for quality of material and comfort, I would like to give these headphones a 4 out of 5 on quality of material.",724

2168,"to make it even better the microphone is perfect, I took an audio clip with my iPhone's voice recorder and everything was completely clear (granted the house was quiet,) but I had no distortion or anything.",726
2169,Hope this review isn't to confusing and if you have questions please ask!,726
2170,I wish that the fit was adjustable.,726
2171,"Plug doesn't fit my macbook pro; too loose, keeps falling out.",726
2172,These are probably my biggest complaint with the device.,726
2173,You simply can't go wrong with a Sony product.,726
2174,"These are not the best headphones in the world, but they might just be the best $15 headphones in the world.",726
2175,When their parents tell me that their kids lost or broke their $200 dollar headphones I just smile.,727
2176,"The range is good as well, compared to my previous headphones by Active.",727
2177,I have issues with headphones and I seem to go through a lot of them but I've had these for several months now and they are really perfect to me.,727
2178,The price is very cheap for what they're worth.,727
2179,So far it works nicely but cant comment on the battery life.,727
2180,Obviously the quality isn't great compared to high end models but for the price they are a great buy.,727
2181,I'm going to put a piece of tape over it and hopefully that solves the problem.,727
2182,I have dropped them once or twice and they still work.,727
2183,Comfy headphones that do not bother me after prolonged usage.,727
2184,They go in the backpack with lunch box and everything else squished and squashed :-).,727
2185,"I did that, but the sound quality was still bad.",727
2186,I've purchased three pairs of these for my kids (two pairs in white/pink and one in blue/black).,727
2187,"If you want the best sound and bass, don't be an insufferable cheap bstard and buy bose or beats.",727
2188,these headphones have very good sound quality for the price.. they are comfortable and hardly weigh anything.. the white color stands out and it looks sweet.,727
2189,Sound is clear and loud.,727
2190,I haven't charge it yet and I have been using it for 8 hours from out of the box.,727
2191,"On the calls I've tried, it works just fine.",727
2192,I didn't realize how much I missed the bass that my earbuds didn't supply.,727
2193,guess i'll be returning these Sony ones and forking up the extra $30 bucks for another pair of Sennheisers.,727
2194,"These are really affordable headphones, nice and loud with decent bass.",727
2195,Love the color and the sound is great!!!!,727
2196,"I'm a musician so I'm always looking for great studio heaphones or personal monitors, these headphones are worth every penny!",727
2197,"With such a short cord, the MDR-ZX100's are pretty much only suited for use with an mp3 player that you carry on you, or maybe with a computer desktop where the computer is directly in front of you (with the audio jacks up front).",727
2198,Sony's MDR-ZX100's are amazing.,727
2199,They feel cheap but don't look it so I guess that is okay.,727
2200,I've used this for about two weeks.,728
2201,Feels comfortable as well sometimes i forget they are on.,728
2202,I guess I should have paid more attention to the reviews before ordering.,728
2203,"In sum, it's a great deal.",728
2204,But its nice and durable.,728
2205,So with this order we have a set in the living room and now in the bedroom.,728
2206,I'm not a music mixer or anyone with an ear for sound that has specific needs.,728
2207,The sound quality is biased towards the bass side of neutral which is not my preference - but we are discussing $14.00 phones!,728
2208,I bought these to replace a pair of soundbot bluetooth headphones I purchased about 10 months previously.,728
2209,I choose the Sony's because I have enough familiarity with Sony headphones to know that they are very clean.,728
2210,I was also very surprised at how comfortable they are.,728
2211,I have tried them out and can't find a thing wrong with them.,728
2212,The product that came in the box looked alright but it was closed tight with just tape.,728
2213,"(about 48 inches long)
The sound quality is decent, not professional quality obviously but not that horrible flat sound you get with many ear buds.",728
2214,Good quality headphones.,728
2215,I've tried turning them up as loud as I could with volume on my iPhone and on the headphones and they still aren't that loud.,728
2216,This is my second pair - after owning the 220s for a year or more I got the 240s for my wife for exercising and she likes them a lot.,728
2217,"I traveled with these, stuffing them in the most obscure places.",728
2218,"The microphone does not register anything at all until you are speaking at COMICALLY LOUD VOLUMES, and my guildies on ventrilo tell me the mic sounds like I'm yelling into an old time radio inside a tin can underwater.",728
2219,"The white is nice and the red is a cute touch, I get a lot of compliments on these.",728
2220,The cord is perfect for me but that is because I am short so the cord is not super long for me.,728
2221,This headphone is the bomb.,728
2222,They fit nicely on the head and the cushion sits fine after wearing them for long periods of time.,728
2223,They stick out a lot and make you look funny.,728
2224,I would like to know if any recalls are available for this item!,728
2225,"The wife liked them so much for the gym, she had me order her a second set to wear at work.",729
2226,A real plus is that I can war them at home and not have to have my phone close.,729
2227,"They fit her perfectly and they were what she wanted (over the ear, cutting out outside noise) with good sound.",729
2228,The left speaker blew out after about two months of use.,729
2229,"-They stay on perfectly well while I exercise (workouts generally include lots of movement, and LOTS of sweat).",729
2230,If anyone would find these painful it would be me.,729
2231,"For this price, that's fine.",729
2232,and they also look awesome when i work out!,729
2233,If you have a lot of music on your cell phone you will enjoy this headset.they are very comfortable to wearand the batteries last all day.,729
2234,The Mopw set worked well but was not a great fit (secure wise) but was broken in half when someone moved the couch back up against the computer table.,729
2235,"Behringer phones best sound output, bests the Philips, can handle volume, but emit vinyl fumes.",729
2236,The wire is excellent.,729
2237,I stongly recommend in investing in these headphones.,729
2238,I love the headphones.,729
2239,"The combo sounds clear, lows are present but not pronounced some what tinney but I wasn't expecting a high end product so it's good for a quick fix or road trip, get them at walmart  $30.00.",729
2240,The only difference between these functions it how long the button is held or whether it is hit more than once.,729
2241,The quality when using it for phone calls is very poor.,729
2242,"All in all a good purchase when I got them, and they still are 4 months later.",729
2243,"My first set was the BTH220, and I loved them so much I bought the 240.",729
2244,"I received a replacement set within a few days, with no hassle.",729
2245,"They definitely get the job done and for the price, there really isn't any complaint I could make.",729
2246,I'm not a music mixer or anyone with an ear for sound that has specific needs.,729
2247,You simply can't go wrong with a Sony product.,729
2248,"Not only is the sound quality excellent (again, not compared to Sennheiser or other premium brands), but they are also amazingly durable.",729
2249,"I had one issue with hearing my wife on the phone yesterday, but that also may have been because she was using her cellphone's speaker.",729
2250,I have had many Sony products over the yrs and have always been impressed.,730
2251,The sound quality is outstanding as well.,730
2252,"I'm sure they'll be put to good use, but if you get too rowdy @ the ""Ponder the Mystery Party"", Baby these  are comin' out!",730
2253,"- I don't care how cheap it is, if your product is not really noise canceling, do not advertise it as such.",730
2254,"And thats not even the loudest the headphones can go, I have not tried these at full volume, and I don't plan on it, I'd rather not blow the speakers.",730
2255,I am overall very impressed with this company.,730
2256,"Every pair of ear buds I owned got thrown around, stomped on and used even more than I used these headphones, but ear buds lasted me twice as long.",730
2257,I love that they fold and come with a storage bag which means it can be stored easily in my gym bag.,730
2258,"The earlier pairs I had were decent, they'd last about 6 months then just stop working.",730
2259,These headphones are hard to beat for the price.,730
2260,The sound quality is great on the kinivo.,730
2261,Turns out they are uncomfortable for me.,730
2262,"I listen to different kinds of music, pop, rap, instrumental, Polynesian, classical, etc.",730
2263,I use these primarily for listening to training videos or low volume music when reading.,730
2264,This is whayy better than the bluetooth devices that you simply plug into your ear.,730
2265,I quickly discovered the wire was loose at the end connecting to plug.,730
2266,"I have more expensive on-ear and over-ear headphones for at-home listening or music production, but I didn't want to use them for outdoor activities for obvious reasons.",730
2267,Stretching them out helps for a while but even the loosest setting was not enough for me.,730
2268,The sound quality was horrible and I hated having them in my ear.,730
2269,After receiving this product I discovered that it didn't live up to my expectations.,730
2270,Do not make the same mistake .,730
2271,I use them daily.,730
2272,"But they look
pretty cool and i may recommend the seller.",730
2273,The headband is way too rigid and totally uncomfortable.,730
2274,I would have given it 5 stars.,730
2275,"i was discussed with the sound quality of these headphones, Sony dropped the ball on these.",731
2276,These can be bought for prices as low as $14 or $12.,731
2277,"Excellent headset for price, very comfortable.",731
2278,I do not recommend these headphones for anyone who has a large head.,731
2279,"Pros: easy to connect, clear connection, compact

Cons: not tight enough on my ears nor my husband's therefore does not block out much background noise/other music at the gym

Overall, I am disappointed.",731
2280,"Maybe these aren't perfectly audiophile but it would be hard to touch this quality without spending a whole, whole lot more.",731
2281,"But for the price, I think that these are way more than worth it if you need a cheap pair of headphones that will last you longer than twinkies in the post nuclear world.",731
2282,Headphone is very lightweight and confortable.,731
2283,Connected to ASUS PC via Polk Radio amplifier.,731
2284,Work great for everyday use and the battery life seems good.,731
2285,There are no better headphones on Earth for this price.,731
2286,He has nothing but great things to say about this product.,731
2287,I like the white color and the red detail.,731
2288,Turns out they are uncomfortable for me.,731
2289,"These are exactly what I needed, and way better than what I thought I'd get.",731
2290,I got these for my daughter's 12th birthday and she loves them.,731
2291,The sound quality is very good for the price.,731
2292,I use them to work out and have yet to have them fall off regardless how much movement is going around.,731
2293,They fold up so nicely and fit in my bag to take anywhere I go.,731
2294,"The controls are a delight to use, and easy for your fingers to scope out, even though you can't see them.",731
2295,They are quite light as well.,731
2296,"For the asking price, these are excellent quality and a fantastic value.",731
2297,I received the item within two days of placing the order so I was extremely happy about that.,731
2298,"Plus, the cups themselves are not too big and bulky, so they're very easy to carry around and fit in your backpack.",731
2299,You won't regret it!,731
2300,"I guess they are worth the 18 bucks, but not much more.",732
2301,"Once in a while, they'd nip one of my hairs in the joints.",732
2302,Bought these specifically to use with my Dish Network Hopper.,732
2303,iv had them for over 6 months and they fit really well (i have a big head)i use them EVERY DAY!,732
2304,"These headphones are wonderful, I can do all those things and more and not have to worry about a cord getting tangled or tying me to my phone.",732
2305,The distance for these is good as well - I have yet to go past their reach.,732
2306,Sony tends to always make good headphones with quality sound.,732
2307,If I wear them longer than 4 hours they start to get uncomfortable because the plastic band is a bit thicker than other models so they start to irritate the back of my ear but in a way that is a good thing because they seem pretty darn sturdy.,732
2308,"Couple of other folks have them, and they all gave me positive reviews which influenced my purchase even more.",732
2309,The only negative is the strap around the head is not adjustable and stiff.,732
2310,I saw several people during my travels wearing these headphones so I would guess they are fairly popular.,732
2311,"Over the years I used to spend about $20 every two months on earphones that get caught in spokes, suffer water damage, get frayed, experience impact damage, or just generally short out or stop functioning.",732
2312,Sounds good for the modest price.,732
2313,I am not happy with them.,732
2314,I do not think that I will be buying another pair when (more like if) these die on me.,732
2315,I purchased them to listen to audiobooks on various devices.,732
2316,"Only ""problem"" is the plastic part that goes over your head doesn't bend much so it looks a little funny when you wear them, but not a big deal at all.",732
2317,We've owned three pairs of these headphones.,732
2318,Plugging them into my computer at home was no better.,732
2319,"If you wear a larger hat size, these headphones are probably not for you.",732
2320,Oh mey gerd...I ordered a pair of headphones and guess what I got?!,732
2321,The earbuds are heavily padded and soft as well.,732
2322,No single frequency range dominates.,732
2323,I specifically wanted pure white headphones (that one little red line doesn't bother me; it helps me distinguish right v. left ear),732
2324,They are reasonably light and nicely padded around the ears.,732
2325,"They are low, really low compared to the Sony MDR-V150.",733
2326,I've changed the rating to the 5 stars this replacement pair deserves.,733
2327,I also wear glasses.,733
2328,"Good sound, fine bass that does not overpower the mids and highs.",733
2329,The cushions are comfy and the wires are strong.,733
2330,"Good quality, great price.",733
2331,Will be picking up a second set for myself so I can listen to some tunes at the office.,733
2332,I've had mine for years and they still work.,733
2333,Just want I needed.,733
2334,The controls are very intuitive.,733
2335,"For the sound quality, you get more than what you paid for.",733
2336,I compared them to the audio with a friend's Beats Solo HD ($199) and to be honest they sounded almost exactly the same.,733
2337,"For the price, the headphones are awesome!",733
2338,They are very comfortable.,733
2339,But they are really a no go because they're just so uncomfortable to wear!,733
2340,They are snug and perhaps painful with extended use.,733
2341,"It presses into the top of your head no matter how you adjust it, which makes watching movies or multiple episodes of a show with them extremely unpleasant.",733
2342,Usually I'm lucky if they last 6 months.,733
2343,I wasn't disappointed.,733
2344,It's more of a mechanical settle bass.,733
2345,So far (after 4 workouts) they have not let me down.,733
2346,These headphones are amazing.,733
2347,"Really comfort, may be too comfort.",733
2348,Provides descent quality sound and are durable.,733
2349,"I am wearing these headphones right now writing this review, and I am not even listening to music!",733
2350,"I purchased these headphones to be able to listen to music on my iPhone, and take and make phone calls as well as to stream music through either my Mac Book Air or iMac.",734
2351,"It could be made comfortable if it were adjustable, but it isn't.",734
2352,"I've had these headphones for less than six months and now the left side has blown out, for $25 I kind of expected more.",734
2353,"The sound quality is also a 10, just enough bass.",734
2354,Do not recommend.,734
2355,Does not feel flimsy at all.,734
2356,"CONS---
There are none, I'm happy to report.",734
2357,"As you can tell by looking at the photos, there is not any room between the plastic top of the headphones and the headphones themselves.",734
2358,great for those days when the maintenance guys are using the leafblowers.,734
2359,I was searching high and low for bluetooth wireless headphones to use with my iPhone and iPod.,734
2360,"I had the older vesion of these headphones and those were lightweight, and suprisingly, built like a tank.",734
2361,"I got a call while running the other day and I had no trouble picking it up, I heard them clearly and they could hear me as well.",734
2362,"They are not really noise cancelling, but are effective and comfortable.",734
2363,"As of today July 9, 2016 they will not hold a charge.",734
2364,"My only quibbles are the fit (they keep sliding off of my ears -- I have small ears and long hair that tucks behind my ears and I often wear the headphones and sunglasses at the same time, and the headphones won't stay on.",734
2365,"I would expect three weeks out of a pair of ear buds I got from the dollar store, but not from a well-reviewed, kinda pricey set of headphones!",734
2366,"In case they do die, I will buy these again.",734
2367,I would buy again.,734
2368,I really like it for listening functions.,734
2369,The okay: I must have small ears.,734
2370,I've purchased three pairs of these for my kids (two pairs in white/pink and one in blue/black).,734
2371,I have seen amazing reviews of this product on amazon and that's why I ordered it.,734
2372,Body is excellent.,734
2373,"The rigid behind the head bar is just a skotch too small, the phones might fall off if I move carelessly.",734
2374,I was hoping they would balence out more and give better quality but that never happened.,734
2375,"However, I don't like exercising with it.",735
2376,We have 3 pairs of these in our house as everyone kept stealing mine.,735
2377,I find them very comfortable and the white on white color scheme is very sharp.,735
2378,"The audio sounds great, it holds a charge for a very long time, and paired immediately.",735
2379,Though not flush it fits your ear well and is not loose.,735
2380,I was tired of having to worry about my headphone cords getting caught under something.,735
2381,"It keeps cutting out, or warbling distortedly.",735
2382,"Don't drink and Drive unless your good at it, I used to be.",735
2383,I have has the for 5 whole days now.,735
2384,These headphones work really well.,735
2385,I'm not an audiophile.,735
2386,I purchased these expecting them to be comfortable and have better than normal sound.,735
2387,I wish their quality control was better.,735
2388,"For 5 dollars more, the Sony MDR-V150 headphones are WAY better.",735
2389,Fits any head size.,735
2390,"I like the Kinivo, and I will continue searching for a different BT transmitter that will hopefully pair successfully.",735
2391,I have used it for about a month now and I love this product.,735
2392,It is hard for them to keep ear buds in their ears.,735
2393,Save your money and get a different product.,735
2394,They just won't charge anymore.,735
2395,"I received these on time and have only had them a few days, but they have worked great.",735
2396,I stongly recommend in investing in these headphones.,735
2397,It came with everything the back had listed on it and the jack was wrapped perfectly which gave me the impression that they weren't even plugged in.,735
2398,Will be getting a lighter pair next.,735
2399,I'm also a musician (bass) and  I think the music quality is very good.,735
2400,Happy with the price point and glad I purchased them.,736
2401,They exert some kind of pressure on my ears.,736
2402,I have apple head phones from 2 years ago and I kick the crap out of them and still no damage and no drop in performance.,736
2403,I like to listen while cleaning house.,736
2404,I like the headphones and they're reasonably good for sound.,736
2405,"I thought they sounded great, I'm sure others are better but these are so cost effective I could buy a pair for less then $30 which is amazing.",736
2406,"If you put these in a backpack or duffle, be extremely careful.",736
2407,"If activated once to open up voice calling on my smartphone it works wonderfully, but the headset refuses to perform the action again and provides a low-pitch beep that does little more than annoy.",736
2408,These are just what I wanted.,736
2409,One thing to be aware of when turning off the power to the headset.,736
2410,I can tell I have a headset on when talking to others but they all say they cant tell one bit that I was on my headset!,736
2411,The bass is weak and oppressed.,736
2412,"The ear cups pivot to fold flat, and fit in the shallow drawer of my media cabinet.",736
2413,"Needless to say, I am returning this item.",736
2414,"The last time this happened, I turned the headphones off and on again, which fixed the issue.",736
2415,The headset works as I expected.,736
2416,"They would no longer hold a charge so I upgraded to this model, the BTH240.",736
2417,Music is full and clear.,736
2418,These headphones were a very comfortable fit for me and have remained durable even after being carelessly handled several times.,736
2419,I recommend these as a good-looking pair to wear in public.,736
2420,I purchased these to use as hands free calling.,736
2421,They have good sound for just listening to music or movies.,736
2422,"Just recently the plug does not stay in all the way in the headphone jack of either my iPad Mini, my Lenovo Tablet, or the TV.",736
2423,Built quality is sub par and very disappointing emotions.,736
2424,It seems to me that they last wayyyy longer than 10 hours.,736
2425,I have to sit directly in front of the stereo on the floor to use them.,737
2426,Total distortion at any reasonable listening level that I like.,737
2427,I'm a teacher at a small alternative high school with students who have major behavioral issues.,737
2428,"Sound is pretty good, but do not buy if you intend to use for workouts.",737
2429,Now if you're expecting a high end sterophile experience then look elsewhere.,737
2430,For the price paid these are decent headphones.,737
2431,They where very comfortable and soft so I was very disappointed.,737
2432,These headphones have great clarity listening to music with ample bass.,737
2433,"Just like the price of these headphones, the quality is also low.",737
2434,"Look, you are getting what you are paying.",737
2435,I like the thick cord.,737
2436,"2) The headband does not have any padding, and this caused a little bit of discomfort for me.",737
2437,I truly feel this is the best bang for your buck headphones.,737
2438,"My PC with Windows 8, allows me to chose my default sound source, either computer speakers, or the Kinivo headset.",737
2439,Gift for my wife as she had been using some pretty crude earphones to listen to music from her laptop.,737
2440,Went upstairs and into bedrooms and it worked clearly as it did standing next to it.,737
2441,They where very comfortable and soft so I was very disappointed.,737
2442,These were perfect for that purpose!,737
2443,I don't think they are made to be waterproof.,737
2444,"Thought about giving this 3 stars but for the money, I just can't complain that much.",737
2445,"One problem is they are a little small, and hurt your ears after a while.",737
2446,I knocked off 2 stars because of the ergonomics.,737
2447,The cord is around 4 ft. in length but it is not bulky.,737
2448,These are good if you are looking for cheap headphones.,737
2449,These broke after about 2 months of use.,737
2450,This unit would be fine for somebody with a narrow head or a child but normal sized people should buy something else.,738
2451,My head is not particular bigger the other people.,738
2452,This is NOT Amazon's fault.,738
2453,"I was hoping for a headset to listen to music while I do manual work and chores, but it provides so little protection from outside noise that it's nearly useless for that.",738
2454,"This is my 2nd pair, the sound quality, comfort, and overall feel is just second to none for the very affordable price.",738
2455,"The louder you set the volume, the shorter the battery life.",738
2456,great for those days when the maintenance guys are using the leafblowers.,738
2457,They stay in place while running and can get loud enough to block out surrounding noise.,738
2458,It is very nice to be able to move around my work space without a cord tethering me to the computer.,738
2459,:)  These push against my cartilage after a while.,738
2460,After more than a year and it's still working like new!,738
2461,But it's a good deal for what I'm using it for.,738
2462,They are moderately comfortable but I would not wear them for more than an hour or so.,738
2463,I love their sound quality.,738
2464,Did I mention that they run for a very long play at peak volumne and they fold up nicely?,738
2465,"There is some getting used to the controls- volume, pause, bluetooth, etc.",738
2466,Fits any head size.,738
2467,These headphones are also very comfortable and felt great on my head.,738
2468,"It's light weight, portable, comfortable, low profile easy to use and rugged.",738
2469,It is really a shame because the headphones are still good but I cannot use them any more.,738
2470,Highly recommend.,738
2471,This last pair has lasted for over a year.,738
2472,The collapsible headphones make for easy storage but because of this the headphones are small on the head.,738
2473,How you can get this much quality for such a low price.,738
2474,I have forgotten a few times and it lasted an additional week.,738
2475,I am an editor and I use these for simple editing in coffee shops.,739
2476,I also use them to listen to iHeart Radio from my iPhone.,739
2477,Very nice shape and form.,739
2478,"Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone - Supports Wireless Music Streaming and Hands-Free calling (Black) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
Really like these.",739
2479,They still work as well as they did the day I got them.,739
2480,As far as I can tell awesome product.,739
2481,I compared them to the audio with a friend's Beats Solo HD ($199) and to be honest they sounded almost exactly the same.,739
2482,I think when using on a mobile device the quality of the sound is not as good as when you use it on the computer.,739
2483,I purchased the LG tone pro afterward and was diss appointed because they were twice as expensive and half the quality.,739
2484,"Works fine, but not satisfied with quality.",739
2485,Best investment ever!,739
2486,So far it works nicely but cant comment on the battery life.,739
2487,I am returning this and will look for something better.,739
2488,Middle range is also fine.,739
2489,"The way they wrap around the back of the neck makes it difficult to wear them while lying down or reclining, e.g.",739
2490,These head phones have worked like charm.,739
2491,If it manages to stay connected audio becomes laughably out of sync.,739
2492,"I had tried a couple other pair and always ran into the same problem, they were so uncomfortable that I couldn't wear them for more than 5 minutes without wanting to throw them across the room.",739
2493,I am a bigger guy with a larger head so the headset is a little tight around the back of my head.,739
2494,They are exactly what I wanted I got them for my husband for Christmas and he loves he works in a factory with loud machines all around him and with these the noise is not a problem all He  could hear is  his music,739
2495,"They sound great, and function intuitively.",739
2496,The battery lasts about 10 hours listening to music.,739
2497,For the past 12 years I've always bought LabTec 820's but since they've stop making those I had to resort to these headphones.,739
2498,"Only good for small digital devices, which is why I bought them.",739
2499,These sound amazing for the price.,739
2500,But if your like me then I bet you will be satisfied with the average quality.,740
2501,These headphones have great style and sound.,740
2502,The midranges and the highs serve to add dimension and overall they are biased pretty well.,740
2503,Worth the money.,740
2504,but once i put them on i realized they had amazing quality.,740
2505,For me it was very loose even with it clinging on my ears.,740
2506,"However, if you want to use these headphones to eavesdrop on people, it's a five-star product.",740
2507,Can't wear for more than a few minutes unless I only keep it on one ear.,740
2508,"As far as battery life, I've not had to charge them yet.",740
2509,I won't detract a star for this design because the knivo is an excellent product.,740
2510,I doubt I'll need to any time soon.,740
2511,I feel like I got an incredible bargain for the price with this product.,740
2512,"I have been told by the parties on the receiving end that I can be heard better using these than using just the cell, or the cell with earbuds and mic.",740
2513,They stay put without issue.,740
2514,Not a bad price either.,740
2515,"If activated once to open up voice calling on my smartphone it works wonderfully, but the headset refuses to perform the action again and provides a low-pitch beep that does little more than annoy.",740
2516,"Generally, hardware with SONY written on the side of it performs well.",740
2517,Easily paired to my android phone and stays in place while I workout.,740
2518,Inexpensive and works fine.,740
2519,I was skeptical with what the quality would be like considering the low price.,740
2520,"I've had them for over two hours, listening to Alpha/ BiNatural beats while reading.",740
2521,Wish these were water resistant like the ones Kinivo recently pulled from the market (don't know why) but all in all these are a very good choice for this kind of head phone.,740
2522,I received the item within two days of placing the order so I was extremely happy about that.,740
2523,My reference system comprises Beyer Dynamic DT 990 Premium 600 OHM Headphones using Benchmark DAC1 to drive the Beyers.,740
2524,When these break I will buy another pair.,740
2525,Excellent sound quality.,741
2526,I suspect that has more to do with Windows 8 being a terrible OS than anything else.,741
2527,It matches my white Sony Vaio too which is a plus.,741
2528,It isn't surround-sound quality.,741
2529,"I purchased this Bluetooth headset to replace a Sound Bot headset that worked but always seemed clumsy, cheap and looked a bit dorky.",741
2530,"Overall, great product and worth the cost!",741
2531,"I used to borrow the school's headphones, but I didn't like the idea of using something that hundreds of other students were using.",741
2532,"These headphones are alright for the task, but two issues are annoying me such that I'll soon be replacing them.",741
2533,Can take a beating from my 5 year old and my 6 year old.,741
2534,Turn it up and jam!!!,741
2535,EDIT: I had a friend of mine (a youngish girl) try them on.,741
2536,After a lot of research I decided to try these.,741
2537,They've got no high end at all.,741
2538,"I heart radio sounds good on it for the price of the headphones, don't have to give my phone to my wife anymore to watch incoming calls due to the in coming call feature.",741
2539,So far so good with these.,741
2540,It was delivered on time and came in good condition so I'm overall okay with it.,741
2541,overall a great purchase for a great price!,741
2542,Can take a beating from my 5 year old and my 6 year old.,741
2543,"Choose to go forward or backward , answer your phone, recall the last number.",741
2544,Range a little challenging sometimes.,741
2545,I do not like those earbud style headsets.,741
2546,"It's a little harder to understand people that are talking to you, but you'll hear that they are talking if you're not blasting music.",741
2547,A design plus is the red band on the right side.,741
2548,Its a decent product but not what i was looking for.,741
2549,"The reason I don't score higher is this: cord does not separate from headphones, so if it goes, you have to replace all.",741
2550,I got one for my self then got two more for family.,742
2551,I use first one with my WALKMAN.,742
2552,Would buy again.,742
2553,The head set is incredibly comfy and folds up very nicely.,742
2554,Happy with my purchase!,742
2555,I have tried them out and can't find a thing wrong with them.,742
2556,"Great little bluetooth headset, great price, extremely fast shipment, great battery life, and comfortable too.",742
2557,i walk around w/o iphone in my hand in the house and it still sound great.,742
2558,"Wow, as another reviewer described, these are very uncomfortable, at least on my ears.",742
2559,They stay on your head very well when you go running.,742
2560,"I received a 3.5mm male jack, but have easily fixed this foible with an adapter for $0.90.",742
2561,"The battery life is excellent, I've never had the battery run down on me.",742
2562,They're super durable.,742
2563,They are exactly like the picture looks.,742
2564,I used these for about a month until the battery died.,742
2565,The hearing quality of this headset is good but they fit loose on my ears.,742
2566,"I would expect three weeks out of a pair of ear buds I got from the dollar store, but not from a well-reviewed, kinda pricey set of headphones!",742
2567,Tried another brand but they weren't as nice as these by a long shot.,742
2568,"Sony logo does wear out after couple of months, regular wear and tear.",742
2569,I can barely feel that they are even on my head.,742
2570,They have good clear sound reproduction as well they adjust all the way down to fit a smaller child's head with no problem.,742
2571,"It's pretty interesting, I am a Sony guy, TV's, Playstations, Phones for years.",742
2572,I had these for a while till  bought some Skullcandy headphones and I gave these to my brother.,742
2573,These work just as well.,742
2574,The sound is spectacular!,742
2575,Save money and time here.,743
2576,"Be aware though the cord is around 3', so you'll need to either buy an extension if you need a longer distance or buy another brand entirely.",743
2577,"Only good for small digital devices, which is why I bought them.",743
2578,"The audio quality is good, especially considering the fact that they only cost $20 on average.",743
2579,"I don't know how they even justified the largest setting, as no one must have a head that large
-These are NOT circumaural.",743
2580,"I like the Kinivo, and I will continue searching for a different BT transmitter that will hopefully pair successfully.",743
2581,"After reading good reviews, I settled on these and I'm glad I did.",743
2582,I was surprised on how good the bass was (for twenty something bucks).,743
2583,"This is more the style of the earphone class, and not particular to this model.",743
2584,"Stays securely in place, even on long runs.",743
2585,Looks like a very expensive pair of headphones and has good sound.,743
2586,"But otherwise, perfect.",743
2587,"Comfortable, and a long enough line.",743
2588,"Comfortable, and a long enough line.",743
2589,It isn't surround-sound quality.,743
2590,Used my 220s for over a year(8-10 hours a day) and they recently started having speaker issues so I upgraded to these.,743
2591,"Overall, I still liked this on-ear product if you're quite tired of using in-ear.",743
2592,"Chord is long too, and really good to use this on the treadmill.",743
2593,I purchased the Artic P311 and Kinivo BTH204 together.,743
2594,They paired with my iPod and my Galaxy 3 Droid phone effortlessly.,743
2595,Simple headphones...they make the gym session go by faster...the blue part of the headphones are obviously cheap plastic not matted like the images....good headphones overall.,743
2596,I am happy with the purchase overall and would recommend them -- just to someone with a bigger head or bigger ears.,743
2597,"What's even worse is that when the battery gets low, these will emit a series of loud beeps in your ears that signal the battery is about to die.",743
2598,And by the time I realized this I was out of the return window.,743
2599,What you get are well constructed headphones with solid performance and very good Sony quality.,743
2600,"When I ordered this product I thought it was just going to be another pair of headphones, boy was I wrong.",744
2601,"Best pair of headphones I have ever owned, and for that price they're a steal!",744
2602,I purchased the Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo headphones specifically for walking/running while wearing sunglasses.,744
2603,"I've only had them for a couple of weeks and only have one small complaint, while running, I have the volume down to a lower level, I can hear one of the buttons rattle.",744
2604,The button changes don't improve or worsen my review.,744
2605,I tested these headphones on both my iPod touch and my PC and they both play beautifully but if you want it for use on your computer note that the cord is no more than two feet of extra cord.,744
2606,Only finally found ONE image.,744
2607,Might give this to my more petite wife and find something else!,744
2608,I use it for biking to work and listening to music or podcasts.,744
2609,I ordered another pair and they came right away.,744
2610,This is definitely worth your money,744
2611,They are Perfect!,744
2612,"For the price, the headphones are awesome!",744
2613,I used these for about a month until the battery died.,744
2614,I bought these headphones because I needed something for my digital media class and I didn't want to spend a fortune.,744
2615,Personally I feel that they are better.,744
2616,"I'm not sure if this is the headphones or the mp3 player I use, but it only works somewhat.",744
2617,"If you sit or lay in absolute darkness, they can light up half the room lol.",744
2618,Haven't needed to charge the battery again yet.,744
2619,I also wanted to buy something very cheap so I don't need to worry about losing it or getting it stolen.,744
2620,Not so on other brands.,744
2621,I Olympic weightlift and these do not slip during any movement.,744
2622,"The volume does not go very loud, and has little to no bass.",744
2623,I am sure it would work fine if I wanted music playing on it the entire time.,744
2624,Build quality is nice as well; sturdy plastic.,744
2625,They can get pretty loud.,745
2626,But when i buy this sony for remplace mines this was a big mistake!!!,745
2627,Love the fact that they are very stylish and look more expensive that the retail price however the sound it's too low I have to turn up all the volume in order to have a nice sound,745
2628,Very impressed with the quality of the product.,745
2629,The other loses connection often as it tries to connect to every device at once.,745
2630,SO these are comfortable.,745
2631,"Since these headphones are placed on the back of neck, it is hard to tell you whether they are going to fit you.",745
2632,He has had no complaints!,745
2633,I've been through a few head phones so I was something of a skeptic.,745
2634,I can keep alert of what happening around me.,745
2635,These headphones have great sound and cost less.,745
2636,freq response very good considering the low price.,745
2637,"And yet, my 4+ year old pair, with cushions that are completely worn out, are really great, and very comfortable to wear!",745
2638,It's a lifesaver!,745
2639,"Bought these a few years ago now as my primary pair at work, they're still going strong and do the job.",745
2640,These headphones are great for my daily walks...they also keep my ears warm in the winter...I live in frigid MN!,745
2641,Only finally found ONE image.,745
2642,"the pros:
1) light
2) good sound
3) good price
4) I can wear them with glasses doesn't bother me.",745
2643,"Both our birthdays are coming next month so I thought I'd buy one, check it out and get another one if I like.",745
2644,My boy bought this headphone with his own money and I just tried it on today to see how a $15 Sony headphone sound.,745
2645,"The sound quality is more improved than the original, and while these headphones do not isolate the user from his or her surroundings, the audio quality is still very crisp and clear.",745
2646,"Be aware though the cord is around 3', so you'll need to either buy an extension if you need a longer distance or buy another brand entirely.",745
2647,The quality of sound for songs and movie is ok with me but I am not expert.,745
2648,So far it works nicely but cant comment on the battery life.,745
2649,"It's certainly adequate, but impossible to describe as loud.",745
2650,Finally got the time to use my headphones yesterday.,746
2651,Sony has had a great reputation for years but it is in decline.,746
2652,"He loved the design and thought the sound was good, but this past week it stopped working.",746
2653,"I usually don't take the time to review things, but this product is an exception I feel that these headphone comparing them to beats on display at the store are almost better.",746
2654,"If he wouldn't have kept them I would have given them a 2, but he thinks they're just fine and hasn't experienced any issues with them.",746
2655,This headset is excellent except for the muffled at times when i talk to someone.,746
2656,"It has a perfect sound, of course we can not compare with other more expensive headphones, but it is great!",746
2657,Bought in January.,746
2658,Such a basic headset and the wire connections get loose?,746
2659,Definitely a great buy!,746
2660,I am using these for watching movies.,746
2661,Con: Well you're outside with these pads on your ears.,746
2662,"I figured that if they were no good, I would lose only $15.",746
2663,They deliver very good sound with this receiver.,746
2664,"My previous headset, an LG HBS-730 had significant issues in this area, and I'm very happy to say the difference between the two headsets is night and day.",746
2665,"Fit well on any audio jack ipod, tablet, desktop, ds, psp, etc.!",746
2666,UPDATE 12 JUN 2015 - My headphones are completely dead now.,746
2667,"Everything breaks form Sony these days, including headphones.",746
2668,Dollar for dollar you cant beat this product.,746
2669,"It would be nice if they folded into a travel pouch, but with all their other virtues plus the low price I'm not complaining.",746
2670,"The Sony Stereo Headphones that I purchased from Amazon are just what I wanted to use with my I-Phone 5, from which I access music from my Amazon cloud.",746
2671,It is annoying enough that I have gone back to a wired set of headphones.,746
2672,It is comfortable and has intuitive controls.,746
2673,"When making calls, I can hear others and they can hear me, even with the windows down in the car.",746
2674,I listen to books on my 12 hour shift and often forget to charge it until it finally begins to die on the third day.,746
2675,"The customer service for this product is outstanding and do the right job to get the job
done in time.",747
2676,Bought them as gifts for directors who were competing at a marching band event and they loved them!!!,747
2677,There are no better headphones on Earth for this price.,747
2678,Will be getting a lighter pair next.,747
2679,I love these headphones.,747
2680,"So, these are decent for the price and for style which is what I prefer (ie neckband with full ear muff).",747
2681,I purchased these in 2011 and are finally starting to reach the end of its life after 5 years of hardcore gym use and constant sweating in.,747
2682,"However, it is comfortable to wear over the head, can be adjusted, has cushion for the ears, and the sound quality is actually very good.",747
2683,Just finally died after the battery did.,747
2684,"I also have a petite frame and, I assume, smaller head and I have lots of room in these in the back so I imagine they'd for someone with a larger head as well.",747
2685,I'm pretty sure its the connection between the wires and the 3.5 mm plug.,747
2686,"Not noticeable at first, but you have to pay attention.",747
2687,"I recommend these to anyone that wants a good, affordable pair of headphones!",747
2688,"Cons:
Don't get too loud
Bass is nothing compared to my cheaper, in-ear buds.",747
2689,Could be me but I don't find myself to be technologically illiterate and I completed normal troubleshooting procedure.,747
2690,"The headphones are nice, as displayed... what i didn't love is the foam, i expected it to be somehow better; then that the power button of the headphones is easily misoperated, as i took the headphones in my pocket they powered up accidentally.",747
2691,Pretty good sound.,747
2692,"It might just be the pair I received, but the range on these are awful when in an open environment (i.e.",747
2693,"i was discussed with the sound quality of these headphones, Sony dropped the ball on these.",747
2694,Also whenever there is high bass the left side begins to rattle badly which disrupts my music.,747
2695,Had the BTH220 for a year and they work good but don't last over 3 hrs on a charge.,747
2696,I love these headphones!,747
2697,"I checked my orders and it literally had the little ""(White)"" in the name.",747
2698,Love these Bluetooth Stereo Headphones.,747
2699,"Also, the volume is great for me and it works well with my hearing aid.",747
2700,Bought for myself.,748
2701,"Turn on the head set, it connects up via the adapter, and switches my audio out to the headset.",748
2702,I just picked up the SONY MDR-ZX100 headphones today and for the small amount I paid I can't believe the big sound I am getting with them.,748
2703,The putting on the side work excellent even allowing you to talk to Siri without ever touching your phone.,748
2704,Highly recommended.,748
2705,I have a small head and have never really liked ear buds because they make my ears really sore after a short time.,748
2706,I can't wait to wear them to the gym tomorrow:),748
2707,The quality of the sound is very decent considering the low price point of these headphones.,748
2708,"Good soun quality for simple video, music and talk hands free.",748
2709,"For $10-15, these are great.",748
2710,Main reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is they can feel loose at times if I am doing more intense workouts.,748
2711,I recommend highly that you buy a pair!,748
2712,"Really good for my four year old, ladted 6 monthes, for the price vs. abuse it was a great deal.",748
2713,But when i buy this sony for remplace mines this was a big mistake!!!,748
2714,These headphones are fine for a normal sized person like my little wifey.,748
2715,I needed a cheap pair of head phones that I was hoping would give decent sound.,748
2716,"Sony MDR-ZX100=sad, sloppy, muddy, and uncomfortable on the cartilage to boot.",748
2717,There was some disconnection when using this outside while shooting hoops.,748
2718,I bought the Kinivo BTH240 Headphones approximately one year and 3 months ago primarily for work.,748
2719,Sound is great!,748
2720,"They fit securely but comfortably around the ears, and I haven't experienced any issue with them wanting to come off during workouts.",748
2721,And they are so much cheaper!,748
2722,Been wearing them since.,748
2723,The headphones are also secure enough to not fall off when you're doing bench press.,748
2724,Great sound for the price.,748
2725,I gave this a 4 star because when walking outside I sometimes lose the connection.,749
2726,It's comfortable.,749
2727,These headphones were exactly what I was looking for.,749
2728,They exert some kind of pressure on my ears.,749
2729,They are comfortable.,749
2730,Some customers had hard time to fit it.,749
2731,They're loud enough and the bass is deep enough and they have accompanied me through some strenuous and sweaty activities.,749
2732,The cord is still 8ft but the head set is comparable in size to the Sony's.,749
2733,"From my wife's point of view, they are light weight, comfortable on her head, and sound very good.",749
2734,"I also have a petite frame and, I assume, smaller head and I have lots of room in these in the back so I imagine they'd for someone with a larger head as well.",749
2735,"Keeping in mind that you get what you pay for, these are actually pretty good.",749
2736,These headphones are comfortable enough that I can have them on for hours without experiencing any discomfort.,749
2737,The frequency response was terrible.,749
2738,"When I told him what I paid, and what these normally cost on the electronics aisle at Walgreens (maybe $20), he asked for a pair of his own.",749
2739,"The most I can say in this case is that I got what I paid for...no more, no less.",749
2740,I love using these when I work out since it allows me to answer phone calls.,749
2741,My happiness scale goes all the way up when I listen to music through these.,749
2742,"At first glance and feel, the headphones, I admit, do feel fragile, almost like they're going to break; but, that isn't true.",749
2743,The other thing is to consider three taps to call as I double tap frequently switching songs and end up calling last number.,749
2744,"The only things I would note are that they feel a bit flimsy and the ""sony"" logo wore off the side within a week.",749
2745,They had offered to send me out a new pair.,749
2746,they make my head look rounder because they are a bit wide but the sound quality is great!,749
2747,We only use these on long trips and they've only been used about 3-4 times.,749
2748,ADDENDUM: Just used my Kinivo BTH240 wireless headphones for the second time in the gym and I experienced A LOT of cutouts and interference this time.,749
2749,Clear sound and good microphone.,749
2750,I got what I payed for.,750
2751,Nothing sounds distorted or shrill.,750
2752,"I chose Sony because the extension connecting the headphones to any device is flexible, thus allowing the headphones to last longer despite.",750
2753,I would highly recommend this product.,750
2754,Probably the best investment I could have made in graduate school.,750
2755,this does not have that problem.,750
2756,They pair nicely and hold a connection with no problem.,750
2757,"Plus, I'm not super picky about anything as long as I can hear my music clearly and enjoy it.",750
2758,"""It appears that you ordered a pair of Sony headphones for $15.86.",750
2759,So far so good.,750
2760,"If you're just looking for decent headphones for occasional use at a reasonable price, these are worth your consideration.",750
2761,I expected better from Sony.,750
2762,You'll get distortion at about 80% on your iDevice.,750
2763,"If you are looking for a sport headphone, get Sony mdr-g45lp, it doesn't have bluetooth but at least it is lighter and cheaper and doesn't hurt.",750
2764,"After four years of use, I have not once regretted purchasing these headphones.",750
2765,"Also keep in mind, because these are behind the ear headphones, if you are leaning back against something, like sitting up in bed or laying down on a pillow, this kind of pushes them forward.",750
2766,Spend a little more and buy something better.,750
2767,Its easy to conceal since it sits comfortably over the ears and behind the neck and under my hair.,750
2768,"These sound very good, not awesome.",750
2769,Much better than the earphones I just paid $120 for and plan to return.,750
2770,"I have two of the older model, both after two years have the rubber/plastic stuff thats on the muffs pealing off.",750
2771,We're totally satisfied with product .,750
2772,"However, it would be even better of they had the option to connect to devices that do not carry the blue tooth feature.",750
2773,I find myself wearing them for hours at a time.,750
2774,"Yes I know they are 15 bucks, but I really expected more given the reviews on Amazon.",750
2775,"I tried the jaybird bluebuds x, and the backbeat fits, both good headphones.",751
2776,I bought a black pair to go along with the black stage dress protocol.,751
2777,The lows are not enhanced and the sound is overall very neutral.,751
2778,"After receiving them timely, putting one set on the shelf, I hooked up the first set.",751
2779,Some final tidbits for those who care about these things.,751
2780,Something I cannot do with a couple of other headphones I own that have oval shaped cushions (i.e.,751
2781,The only issue is when my husband lays down to do any workouts on the bench the back headphone bar pops up and makes the earpieces push up.,751
2782,"I bought them to replace my regular earphones, and my first impression was that they are really good.",751
2783,I like the headphones and they're reasonably good for sound.,751
2784,"The MDR-V300s also have 30mm drivers, but they have a better magnet, which I assume makes a big difference.",751
2785,"I recommend these to anyone that wants a good, affordable pair of headphones!",751
2786,I paid 29.99 for mine and I can't find anything wrong with them.,751
2787,It is perfect for taking outdoors.,751
2788,Not to mention they look pretty snazzy.,751
2789,These are fairly terrible.,751
2790,"Overall, I still liked this on-ear product if you're quite tired of using in-ear.",751
2791,I use them daily.,751
2792,I got one for my self then got two more for family.,751
2793,Finally got the time to use my headphones yesterday.,751
2794,Music quality is good.,751
2795,They ended up being a little hard to hear since they don't block out background noise.,751
2796,I haven't tested with any music loaded on my device but will certainly report back if I see any issues there.,751
2797,I went a whole week using them without having to recharge.,751
2798,"Just like the price of these headphones, the quality is also low.",751
2799,"I'm still on the fence on if I'll be trying another product from the company or not, because I really did feel it was an exceptional product for the price before the incident.",751
2800,"He says they are
 fantastic.",752
2801,"And it works perfectly with my android tablet, PC, and phone.",752
2802,This is definitely worth your money,752
2803,"Plus, if I lost it, I could find it by outputting music to it.",752
2804,Batteries last ~12 hours of playback and as it turns out they work great for phone calls as well - bonus!,752
2805,Headphones fit my head.,752
2806,I found out that after a couple of months of use one of the headphone does not work anymore.,752
2807,They are pretty tight on the ears.,752
2808,These are hands down the worst sounding headphones I've ever owned.,752
2809,I tried running with it but it just didn't work out for me since it wasn't as snug as a fit as I had wanted.,752
2810,The sound quality feedback for talking is very poor.,752
2811,"The 10 hour battery life isn't a big deal, as I only use them for listening to music at work, and I charge them overnight.",752
2812,Headphones exceeded my expectations!!!!,752
2813,"The speaker began to crackle in my left ear (it sounded as if it was max volume out of that ear, while the right ear was working normally at the set volume).",752
2814,Small children I have.,752
2815,"After almost 3 and a half years they still do their job perfectly, just some missing chrome from the track/volume buttons and the outer skin of the pads peeling off.",752
2816,I am looking forward to the increased time I can use the headphones (up to 10 hours?),752
2817,Money well spent!,752
2818,I just picked up the SONY MDR-ZX100 headphones today and for the small amount I paid I can't believe the big sound I am getting with them.,752
2819,My co-worker noticed the improvements that another reviewer has already went into good detail about.,752
2820,"The last pair lasted two weeks, but that was partly due to his best friend.",752
2821,My only complaint... No padding on the headband does start to hurt the top of my head but I will like just glue a strip of phone to the underside and call it good.,752
2822,"Well, four; add on Price.",752
2823,This unit would be fine for somebody with a narrow head or a child but normal sized people should buy something else.,752
2824,The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because they drop calls - even when you have a wifi assisted connection.,752
2825,"Plus, I received them in a matter of days with standard shipping.",753
2826,Maybe it's because I wear glasses.,753
2827,"Really Sony, 3 ft?",753
2828,"If you're really poor, hold out until there's a sale on better headphones.",753
2829,Very disappointed of these headphones because it came out of the box playing out of only the right side... You may not get a defect like me but if you are unfortunate enough to get one then it's very inconvenient.,753
2830,I do not recommend these headphones for anyone who has a large head.,753
2831,I love these headphones.,753
2832,I really look forward to the times when there isn't a lot of background noise and I get to put these on.,753
2833,"Chord is long too, and really good to use this on the treadmill.",753
2834,These are great headphones.,753
2835,im going to keep these until i decide if i want to get better ones!,753
2836,"Thought about giving this 3 stars but for the money, I just can't complain that much.",753
2837,I read one review which states the cords tangle though there's not been a problem with either set I have.,753
2838,"The sound is good and it works as it should, but it's a bit tight over the ears and it's a bit uncomfortable when wearing sunglasses since both would rest over your ear.",753
2839,We bought these for our son and they broke within 90 days.,753
2840,"I don't know how they even justified the largest setting, as no one must have a head that large
-These are NOT circumaural.",753
2841,Body is excellent.,753
2842,"They are not the top of the line, but if you just want comfortable headphones for regular listening...these are great!",753
2843,Just got back from a 2100 mile road trip and these held up to abuses of 3 young boys tossing them around the car for 2 weeks!,753
2844,Sound wise they equal to much more expensive headsets but this problem is enough to turn you off.,753
2845,"Fit snugly, are rugged, pairs easily and can handle phone calls decently (though I have had issues recently where it dropped connection due to low battery).",753
2846,They definitely stick out and I caught quite a few people taking a second glance at me.,753
2847,They even fold up to stow away in my cargo shorts.,753
2848,"If its for regular use and just upgrading from stock headphones then go for it, but if your a audiophile and looking for some new bluetooth headphones skip these as you will be disappointed.",753
2849,I bought mine almost two years ago for twenty bucks and it still works so well.,753
2850,These are fancy and cheap and got good sound quality.,754
2851,I would definitely go with these headphones,754
2852,"All in all a wonderful product, at an amazing price.",754
2853,"I traveled with these, stuffing them in the most obscure places.",754
2854,I should have instead ordered the navy since white catches stains real fast.,754
2855,The Sony seems pretty solid though.,754
2856,Middle range is also fine.,754
2857,The new headset paired immediately with my phone and tablet.,754
2858,Really only good thing about them is they hold charge very well.,754
2859,There is no clarity.,754
2860,So with this order we have a set in the living room and now in the bedroom.,754
2861,Highly recommend.,754
2862,"To that end, I'll be trying the 66 Audio BTS+ next, to see if they're any better.",754
2863,this does not have that problem.,754
2864,"They never break on the band, so they are sturdy...though I do take great care with my headphones as much as possible.",754
2865,I was worried that the area where the ears would rest would be stiff and not be very comfortable against my ears.,754
2866,They were really comfortable but if I wore them for more than a few hours they started to bug my ears.,754
2867,I bought these in 2013.,754
2868,Very much worth the money.,754
2869,I've had a Kinivo BTH240 (black) headset for well over a year and had to buy my girlfriend one too (red).,754
2870,This was a good buy.,754
2871,Like I don't even need to know that dude.,754
2872,I did a lot of research before finally purchasing these and I am happy with my decision.,754
2873,"I bought it for my son, he loves it.",754
2874,I use it for running and walking.,754
2875,I'm using it right now and have been the last 4 hours... still no feed me beep and I still haven't charged it....it's awesome.,755
2876,There is no tin sound or echoes and they go very loud.,755
2877,But its nice and durable.,755
2878,"Not too bad for $15-20 and of course not $200 Beats or Bose sounding, but At $20 I also have a pair of Sennheiser HD202s that blow these Sonys out of the water.",755
2879,I can tell I have a headset on when talking to others but they all say they cant tell one bit that I was on my headset!,755
2880,"Within 6 months, they started breaking.",755
2881,I don't have a little head either.,755
2882,While the rest of the gym endures the noise bleed through their earbuds I'm deep in stereo bliss.,755
2883,"Update 3 Sep 15

They stopped working about a week ago.",755
2884,They stay put once adjusted.,755
2885,still working a month later anyway.,755
2886,I've had mine for years and they still work.,755
2887,These Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones are good.,755
2888,I charge them about once a week if not less.,755
2889,"However, I don't like exercising with it.",755
2890,"The white is nice and the red is a cute touch, I get a lot of compliments on these.",755
2891,(I must write at least two more words to meet length requirement.),755
2892,"I'm a college student with limited transportation options, so none of the return policies would even be worth the money for this garbage.",755
2893,The sound quality was horrible and I hated having them in my ear.,755
2894,"Although I received this item as ""refurbished"", it looks brand new and is in PERFECT working condition.",755
2895,And they are good for that.,755
2896,"Now he can walk around the room, listening to music, while his iPod is charging.",755
2897,"I decided that I wanted to try a bluetooth option for my daily workouts... Let me tell you, I will not miss my annoying earbuds or the cord!",755
2898,"I have been told by the parties on the receiving end that I can be heard better using these than using just the cell, or the cell with earbuds and mic.",755
2899,"i don't like it , because the cable is short , and it's not comfortable :( , a like the sound quality and weight , i shouldn't forget the price , for the price i think it's a nice choice .",755
2900,The only difference between these functions it how long the button is held or whether it is hit more than once.,756
2901,I would buy these again.,756
2902,"Pros:
Stylish look
Comfortable to wear
Deliver's satisfactory sound quality.",756
2903,The 90 degree plug is bulky and  rather awkward.,756
2904,"In fact, these exact ones.",756
2905,I bought some headphones thinking they had Base either than that there good headphones but no Base :( I would recommend this for who ever like headphones with Low Base :),756
2906,"Bass was good, but the mids and highs were not as clear, actually a little muddy and muffled.",756
2907,Guess these might not be all that cool I guess I really don't know but if you are a pork and beaner and looking for about the best $30 dollar item in the whole world this may very well be it.,756
2908,"Cheap feeling, stiff, and basically NO bass whatsoever.",756
2909,Bought two of them and they work great.,756
2910,They block background noise well!,756
2911,I've had them or almost a year & there has been no major breakdown or issues.,756
2912,"Very satisfied with this product and performance - Light weight, comfortable padding for long use, long lasting battery and relatively inexpensive compared to other similar products.",756
2913,"The audio quality, however, was more akin to the $3 headphones that you get on an airplane to watch a movie, and those headphones are meant to be disposable.",756
2914,"This headset is no disappointment very comfortable to ware (I have big head and I will usually feel pressure on my head after 4 hours of wearing it, pretty good compare to 2 hours or less when I wear my other expensive pare)

Highly recommend.",756
2915,"If you want good headphones for a good price,You can't go wrong with these stylish headphones from Sony.",756
2916,"On the left side in particular, the wire pressed against the top of my ear making it a little sore after long use.",756

2918,I am not a techo geek.,756
2919,Even though I dropped it more times than I can count.,756
2920,"Not sure how to resolve that, at least it connects to my phone without issue.",756
2921,I am a bit of an audiophile and purchased MDRZX100/White for a non-music related work.,756
2922,I did sink it to my phone and it was great.,756
2923,I bought the Photive BTH3 instead and wish I hadn't wasted my time these headphones.,756
2924,It is comfortable and has intuitive controls.,756
2925,"The LG's were comfy and looked nice, but when it came to walking or jogging they eventually broke.",757
2926,I get great signal in the room I lift in and even a few rooms over through walls.,757
2927,"I haven't had mine for very long and they seem to be made of cheap plastic, but Sony products tend to last a long time, so I'm not sure about the life span of these.",757
2928,"Sound quality is the same which is good, but they do not quite fit my large head and are not quite as comfortable.",757

2931,"Frame is little bit loose or weak, so it is comfort but easily come off.",757

2933,"I didn't want to support the hyped up Beats, since they're very low quality and very overpriced, but I wanted something that would sound great and look sharp.",757

2937,The actual make up of the product is of high quality as well.,757
2938,"I understand there's instant nostalgia once you realize you're no longer wire bound and your arms are all free and nilly, but trust me read this first.",757

2961,I bought these headphones due to a review by the wirecutter and I can say that it lived up to their praise.,758
2962,Personally I feel that they are better.,758
2963,"I tried other brands and they were okay, but ultimately proved to either be a bit uncomfortable (too rigid) or the speakers would get damaged with the least amount of moisture (sweat).",758
2964,They have rich deep bass and incredibly clear treble!,758
2965,The second pair came in the mail worked great for a week.,758

2997,"-Good sound, with good bass.",759
2998,What I don't like is the sense that it lacks a little oomph.,759
2999,I find the slimmer BTH240 is more attractive and offers controls that are more user-friendly.,759
3000,I have used the bth220 model for the past year and love them but wanted a second pair.,760
3001,I should of bought this headphones a long time ago .,760
3002,Even after sweat they work great.,760
3003,great value for stereo bluetooth headset.,760

3005,Amazon made it easy for me though.,760
3006,I have purchased these headphones twice and I am 100 percent sure that I will not buy another pair of over the head headphones from another company.,760
3007,"The sound quality is not breathtaking my any means, but I believe a very good value for the price.",760
3008,I wish that the fit was adjustable.,760
3009,other than that they hold a long charge.,760
3010,The controls are very intuitive.,760
3011,They work excellent!,760
3012,I will buy more from Kinivo products in the future.,760
3013,"I am a smallish woman with a small head and small ears and there was no way to wear these comfortably, or even in a way that made them feel they would stay on my ears.",760
3014,"These are great, inexpensive headphones for watching Netflix from your laptop or tablet.",760
3015,"SO because of that, I am reordering another of the same pair now in April 2016.",760
3016,I probably got a lemon.,760
3017,"It's kind of a PITA, as I leave the headphones at work and I have to re-pair first thing in the morning, after every meeting, when I return from lunch, etc.",760
3018,"Unfortunately, the left side of the headphones stopped working and has not worked since.",760

3021,Would purchase again without hesitation!,760
3022,"As for the cups themselves, they have a nice cushion.",760
3023,These are built to last!,760
3024,I bought these in red at Ross for $15 because they had a discount for them.,760
3025,So if you're looking for bass you can literally feel (like many headphones provide) these are not for you.,761
3026,"These headphones are alright for the task, but two issues are annoying me such that I'll soon be replacing them.",761
3027,"6) can pair them to my phone, and my laptop.",761

3031,I recently went running with these headphones on and yes it was charging the whole day.,761
3032,The 90 degree plug is bulky and  rather awkward.,761
3033,"They are not the top of the line, but if you just want comfortable headphones for regular listening...these are great!",761
3034,"It also can't seem to communicate properly with my iphone, so that the phone constantly flips over to loudspeaker mode.",761
3035,"They were easy to connect to my iPad, and sound good and have pretty good range.",761
3036,these are at a great price and work great i think i may buy another pair.. the only thing that takes a little getting use to is the behind the neck idea.. but other than that they have a great sound quality and an even greater price....,761
3037,I was pleased that my headphones had arrived ahead of schedule.,761
3038,There was nothing misleading in the description - I think it states 47 1/2 inches and this is accurate.,761
3039,These were a great fit.,761
3040,Here's a hint: EQ them.,761
3041,I also really like the full ear muffs that reduce the background noise so people talking around me don't interrupt my listening pleasure.,761
3042,"The connection to my phone is great, so I can have it in my bag instead of a pocket like with a wired set.",761

3060,It hurt my head to wear them for any longer than 10 minutes.,762
3061,Very comfortable headphones.,762
3062,Seem to eliminate background noise somewhat as well as people can still understand me when I'm out walking around my plant.,762
3063,Wish these were water resistant like the ones Kinivo recently pulled from the market (don't know why) but all in all these are a very good choice for this kind of head phone.,762
3064,"For the price, I can't complain.",762
3065,Feels comfortable as well sometimes i forget they are on.,762
3066,It is not top of the line but you will not go wrong with purchasing it.,762

3073,The headsets don't mush your head and they are very clear.,762

3079,I love being able to watch movies or tv shows without bothering my wife or other people.,763
3080,I guess I was expecting more from these with such high stars and how many people have bought and rated them.,763

3082,Talk about cool in a restaurant.,763

3086,"I don't know what people are talking about, those who rate it like 1 or 2 stars.",763
3087,"We have been very pleased with the quality of these, especially for the money.",763
3088,I am really hoping that the plastic band will stretch a little over time to make them looser.,763
3089,"Bass was good, but the mids and highs were not as clear, actually a little muddy and muffled.",763
3090,I have already grown accustomed to not fighting wires.,763
3091,Not really worth it.,763
3092,I am using these for watching movies.,763
3093,I have the Hopper from Dish and just had to program them in and now I can listened to the music or my shows all over the house...lol I am spoiled and the tone is absolutely wonderful!,763
3094,I will recommend it to anybody who like me has a constraint budget.,763

3096,I will never ever order anything from you and I will advice everyone to stay away from your store.,763
3097,"I've read that some sound quality gets lost, but I never noticed, since I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks.",763
3098,I got this in white for my girlfriend and she really loves them.,763
3099,The cord is fairly large so it doesn't get tangled and it very durable.,763
3100,The over-the-ear design works great -- they stay firmly attached even when I am moving about.,764
3101,Mids and highs are great now.,764
3102,"I purchased this set of headphones, in addition to the Koss UR-20, for use with my portable mp3 player.",764
3103,"They are comfortable and deliver great sound, but the cord is a smidge short and doesn't allow much freedom of movement.",764
3104,"I was okay with all these, since I know they are a new company and will get to the point that they are making good products.",764
3105,"I've purchased other headsets around this price point, and each has failed sooner than expected, in ways that seemed traceable to poor design, workmanship, or materials.",764
3106,"Theses were touted as noise-cancelling or noise reducing, but did neither - They also sound very thin with very little bass.",764
3107,"They can be better, but the price will also be higher.",764
3108,- Playback controls on the right side for easy and convenient access.,764
3109,But it fits on the ears in such a way that it hurts the ears after listening for a while; say 30min.,764
3110,"Hey Joel,

I like the earphones.",764
3111,I mostly listen to spoken word podcast rather than music.,764
3112,Shipped from amazon and got it the next morning (I'm a prime member so I don't know if it'll be that fast for everyone),764
3113,Just a very basic set of headphones.,764
3114,MY SON IS 10 AND I WOULDN'T DARE SPEND WHAT BEATS COST FOR HIM YET!!!!,764
3115,"It could have been a number of things, like my phone had too many apps on, Pandora lost connection or something, but I never experienced those problems while on a corded headset.",764
3116,"I would suggest buying these first, they're great for classical music, rock, and metal.",764
3117,The headphones are also secure enough to not fall off when you're doing bench press.,764
3118,An hour or so and that's all I can take.,764
3119,Also no static at all.,764
3120,Really happy with this purchase.,764
3121,Money well spent!,764
3122,It also costed like 26 bucks.,764
3123,"I love balanced clean sound, but I'm also a child of the 80's... so I like bass I can feel.",764
3124,The sound is great and easily the most value you will find in a quality set of headphones in my opinion.,764
3125,I would not buy again.,765
3126,"Bought this to replace an older model BTH240 (which was great), but this one is slow to connect, frequently drops out or outright disconnects.",765
3127,Fast delivery and great product.,765
3128,I've had mine for two years and it's still going strong!,765
3129,It was worth it to pay a little extra.,765
3130,The play time has been good and about 8 hours on one charge.,765
3131,-The design of the cushions as well as the tension in the headband make these headphones hard to wear for more than 10 minutes.,765
3132,Just finally died after the battery did.,765
3133,"The LG's were comfy and looked nice, but when it came to walking or jogging they eventually broke.",765
3134,"Bass is nice and clear, beat's quality without the hype and 100x price tag.",765
3135,My head's just a little larger than they were designed for.,765
3136,"These are very good headphones, overall.",765
3137,Just got these a couple days ago and I'm very pleased.,765
3138,I've used this for about two weeks.,765
3139,It's neither good or bad.,765
3140,"This was accomplished by using the following steps:
Power off the headphones, Press + ,  and the Pairing button (center)  all 3 simultaneously for 6 seconds.",765
3141,These are my primary headphones doe.,765

3146,Husband loves them really good working.,765
3147,I got his Sony set and I love them.,765

3150,Rugged and not heavy.,766
3151,"I don't personally have any complaints because for the price, they are very good sounding headphones.",766
3152,"I don't know what people are talking about, those who rate it like 1 or 2 stars.",766
3153,If you have to go into another room to not hear outside noises--what's the point of using the headphones?,766
3154,I suppose I was expecting too much at this price range!,766
3155,"Gave it to my 2 year old so she could use it with her ipad, I'll order a different headphones for gaming.",766
3156,Getting another pair only because I can't find my first pair!,766
3157,I don't think they are.,766
3158,"Either way, they're good enough for me.",766
3159,I'm by no means an audiophile.,766
3160,you get what you pay for...,766
3161,"All in all, I would highly recommend these headphones and have recommended them to friends on several occasions.",766
3162,Highly recommended!,766
3163,I have recommended this product to several people.,766
3164,Great item for the price.,766
3165,My old ones had a longer cord but for the price they are still very good.,766
3166,Earpieces fold flat for stowing in a backpack.,766
3167,The biggest difference between these and the old V 150's is that those were very dark and even more veiled sounding.,766
3168,I'm giving these 5 stars only because they do sounds very good for the echeap price.,766
3169,Still worth the price though!,766
3170,"I bought them for my 13 year old son, so his stupid games on his stupid tablet don't annoy me (smiley face).",766
3171,Very comfortable too.,766
3172,I purchased these about 4 years ago and they just died.,766

3176,I used it all of 3 times and then they broke.,767
3177,Love this headset.,767
3178,"If you want bumping phenomenal bass, go pay $300.00 for a pair of Bose headphones.",767
3179,"Not that I was using them... oh, which brings up another good point!",767
3180,I listen to the audio books from my IPhone and I Pad.,767
3181,The red light will go on for just a couple of minutes and then go off..,767
3182,"Other than that, they're fine.",767
3183,I got this for an 2nd Gen Ipod Touch that has a problem with using the Amazon Basic keyboard (even though it's Blutooth).,767
3184,"It doesn't like the below temps, but it seems like it doesn't affect it... yet.",767
3185,"For the price, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.",767
3186,"As of today July 9, 2016 they will not hold a charge.",767
3187,I was a little worried that these would be junk... but they are awesome.,767
3188,"All other affordable headphones have only lasted me a few months, so, needless to say, I was very pleased with this pair.",767
3189,They are not very comfortable.,767
3190,I've used these for over a year now.,767
3191,He uses them often with his iPod.,767
3192,"I've had them for several months (to make sure they didn't short-out like some of the reviews have claimed),and I am totally pleased.",767
3193,My guess is that the batteries started to wear.,767
3194,I wasn't looking to match the sound of my top of the line wired units but I was very pleased when these arrived and I put them to use.,767
3195,Works like it says it does.,767
3196,I purchased the white one for my mother and it looks classy!,767
3197,"They would no longer hold a charge so I upgraded to this model, the BTH240.",767
3198,I have a wonderful 12 yr old who breaks everything that he touches.,767
3199,"I run, so I hate those little earbuds because they always fall out and they irritate my ear.",767
3200,In the sound department they're both great and I have no issue with that.,768
3201,Do yourselves a favor and a little extra money on better headphones!,768
3202,They just last song long.,768
3203,I have to say I am very impressed!,768
3204,"Comfortable, small, lightweight and unobtrusive.",768
3205,There was a lack of bass compared to my Sony MDR-XB500's.,768
3206,"Fast forward to two years ago, and I pick up another pair of these, but in white, since the others had the rip and the white looked cool.",768
3207,The fit is good.,768
3208,"they do hurt my ears if i wear them for too long, but they are my first pair of over ear headphones, so i could be wearing them weirdly, idk lol",768
3209,"I run, so I hate those little earbuds because they always fall out and they irritate my ear.",768
3210,So buy New from another seller.,768
3211,"After I bought these, I noticed that a lot of people have them which is not surprising.",768
3212,Only think I wish it did was fold up for compatibility... Other than that I'm a satisfied mommy!,768
3213,I like the way you can easily fold them to make them fit in your backpack or in a pouch for protection.,768
3214,"Unfortunately, the left side of the headphones stopped working and has not worked since.",768
3215,Might give this to my more petite wife and find something else!,768
3216,These sound horrible and Sony should make the design engineer wear ribbons of shame.,768
3217,These are great quality for such a low price.,768
3218,gonna order a couple more on payday,768
3219,If I wanted something high end I would of paid high end money.,768
3220,"I always tell it like it is, the bad along with the good.",768
3221,I ended up donating them to our local thrift store after one use.,768
3222,A little staticky when touched by where you plug the cord in to your device.,768
3223,You def can hear a wide range of sounds.,768
3224,I would buy them again but my current ones don't look anywhere close to breaking.,768
3225,"Amazing sound and good bass, but the headphones did not look good when you had them on.",769
3226,im going to keep these until i decide if i want to get better ones!,769
3227,"The phones fold/flatten to a nice compact size, great for smaller bags.",769
3228,I purchased these headphones after my daughter broke her pair on Christmas day.,769
3229,"I bought this as a recommendation from Matt Ogus, professional bodybuilder.",769
3230,Still worth the price though!,769
3231,"I try 2wk s ago and love it but the draw back is the stereo sound quality, kind a not so loud to hear the music in a noisy work place.",769
3232,At first was comfortable and snug on my head.,769
3233,"I plan on using this primarily while doing yard work and mowing, so its more liable to get dirty.",769
3234,The headphone jack is really sensitive and you will be fighting with it.. twisting it so the sound doesnt go away.,769
3235,"While I haven't used a measuring tape, I can easily walk around my entire fitness facility and never lose connection.",769
3236,But then I started hearing jumbled voices on a few of my calls and I doubled checked - it wasn't the internet connection.,769
3237,You should be fine if you're only going to do light use.,769
3238,Can't believe they were as inexpensive as they were.,769
3239,"They're not exactly power performers, but then again, you're paying less than $20.",769
3240,The poorly designed bass response was also taken into consideration.,769
3241,Well the headphones weren't picking up on the sound when I was using it with any program on the PC.,769
3242,"Fortunately, someone at Motorola must have foreseen this and engineered these rings that snap off of the earphone, allowing you to wrap the foam over them, and clip them right back on; amazingly increasing longevity.",769
3243,There doesn't appear to be a problem with cable charging while in use.,769
3244,Bought this model upon recommendation from a friend who had used the previous model for about a year.,769
3245,We've gone through a couple of pair but that's due more to misuse on her part.,769
3246,"Great set of headphones,I bought these for my shortwave radio.",769
3247,Would purchase again.,769
3248,I tried the mdrzx300 and they're too tight and I'm already used to the foldability of these!,769
3249,"Best for skinny head people (me = 7.25"" ear to ear)",769
3250,I got these headphones in an odd way.,770
3251,The base response is good.,770
3252,"I was okay with all these, since I know they are a new company and will get to the point that they are making good products.",770
3253,No deep bass like Bose but good dynamic sound & switching to phone calls is seamless.,770
3254,"This model is replacing the better quality, better sounding MDR-V150 model.",770
3255,When I got them I fell in love with them.,770
3256,"My two biggest issues are that when I am listening to music via my Macbook and open a new browser tab, the music gets completely distorted for 10-15 seconds.",770
3257,"The 240 has improved control options, but oddly less range for higher volume?",770
3258,Very nice shape and form.,770
3259,The hard plastic of the headphones band does irritates my ears after about 1 hour of use.,770
3260,These headphones are a godsend.,770
3261,It's pretty darn gross.,770
3262,I love the kid but I really love those ATH-50's and I'm not willing  to make the sacrifice on this particular subject.,770
3263,I use them daily.,770
3264,My first set got me through most of a three-year stint at college before my continued abuse of the wires finally shorted out one ear.,770
3265,These are perfect for what I need.,770
3266,I've bought Sony earbuds for about $10 that sound alot better and dynamic than these headphones.,770
3267,"After a lot of comparison and online soul searching, Kinivo was my choice, as far as price, sound, and comfort it gets 5 stars.",770
3268,Highly recommend.,770
3269,Good enough for me since i'm not that person who spends $$$ on audio quality...,770
3270,15% Discount gets you 1000 sales.,770
3271,"Over the years I used to spend about $20 every two months on earphones that get caught in spokes, suffer water damage, get frayed, experience impact damage, or just generally short out or stop functioning.",770
3272,Quality build you'd expect from Sony as well as quality sound.,770
3273,The wire is excellent.,770
3274,"Their fashionable as well the finish to the headphones are great, as well as being really comfortable and sturdy- you get the feeling that these aren't going to break.",770
3275,I have some hearing deficit so it is much better to watch things on my Ipad with the headphones.,771
3276,"I Google headphones, asked friends for their opinions, YouTubed  videos and ultimately decided to give these a shot.",771
3277,"However, the Kinivo BTH240 pair up every time, no matter what device I am connecting them to...and for a $30 device, this is impressive.",771
3278,"And occasionally if my phone is buried deep in a pocket or a bag, it can be spotty with the bluetooth.",771
3279,The sound quality feedback for talking is very poor.,771
3280,It keeps my ears warms as a plus.,771
3281,"I have reviewed your order and am prepared to assist further.""",771
3282,but they cannot be comfortably worn around the neck as these can.,771
3283,Buy this headphone!,771
3284,Overall I'd recommend it.,771
3285,I broke the first pair in one ear because I pulled the cord hard so I got another pair and they are holding up well.,771
3286,I have had many Sony products over the yrs and have always been impressed.,771
3287,Unfortunately i have gone through 2 pairs of these and both no longer work within 2-3 months of using them 5-6 days a week.,771
3288,"Someone suggested buying a pair of headphones instead of IEM's, and I was in a target one day ruiing the loss of my earbuds and bought these.",771
3289,The cord is long enough for me.,771
3290,Will keep searching for a better one to try.,771
3291,I usually don't have any issues with these headphones.,771
3292,The ear cups are a little small for me.,771
3293,I would characterize my head size as average for an adult male.,771
3294,I bought one of these 2 years ago.,771
3295,That will be the only negative I could find with these headphones.,771
3296,"For the price point, these are mediocre headphones.",771
3297,This is a great product!!!,771
3298,I think these were aimed at teens and tweens with smaller heads.,771
3299,Might as well get the beats by dr dre they are much better the sound stinks!!!,771
3300,Now I am stuck with some useless headphones.,772
3301,"I do not like though, that it is not compatible with my flip phone (my backup) but it is compatible with my Iphone (my everyday phone), so I'm ok with that.",772
3302,"As far as compatibility, the work with Windows Laptop, Windows Phone (1520 and 920 used), as well as any of our Samsung Galaxy devices.",772
3303,"I've only had them for a couple of weeks and only have one small complaint, while running, I have the volume down to a lower level, I can hear one of the buttons rattle.",772
3304,Fits any head size.,772
3305,"Great sound, quality, and bass for the price.",772
3306,so we got another 2 pairs one for each kid and in different colors.,772
3307,I bought and returned a number of headphones the past few weeks.,772
3308,Only alternative was to send them back.,772
3309,The battery lasts about 10 hours listening to music.,772
3310,":)

My little guy likes them also!",772
3311,I use this for my PC.,772
3312,If that could get fixed I'd love these.,772
3313,"The sound is good and it works as it should, but it's a bit tight over the ears and it's a bit uncomfortable when wearing sunglasses since both would rest over your ear.",772
3314,They will amaze you!,772
3315,Once again Sony has proven to provide a good quality product for a very reasonable price.,772
3316,They sit comfortably on your head & ears.,772
3317,They're better than the Skullcandy 2XL's that I was replacing like Pez ... when I can hear them.,772
3318,No complaints at all.,772
3319,"You can bring these up to passable by boosting the treble, but if you're using a device that has no EQ control beyond bass boost they're going to sound very muffled

The insulating pads.",772
3320,"Quality of the voice calls - not sure about that, but people hear me.",772
3321,"It doesn't like the below temps, but it seems like it doesn't affect it... yet.",772
3322,"This was a gift to a friend, but I also have a black one and I use it everyday.",772
3323,"""It appears that you ordered a pair of Sony headphones for $15.86.",772
3324,I'm REALLY suprised by all the 1 and 2 star reviews.,772
3325,"I listen to different kinds of music, pop, rap, instrumental, Polynesian, classical, etc.",773
3326,Pretty good sound.,773
3327,The cord is still 8ft but the head set is comparable in size to the Sony's.,773
3328,I got what I payed for.,773
3329,He loves these headphones and takes them to the gym with him because he likes to listen to music or talk on the phone without having to worry about a cord.,773
3330,"This headphones are very comfortable for extended periods of use, I use them watching movies and they stay in place well with no discomfort to your ears.",773
3331,When i would out on my Treadclimber the sound is great and really gets me going.,773
3332,Worked for about 5 months before dying.,773
3333,The only reason I did not give five stars - they are a little bulky (thick).,773
3334,"I know most people are thinking ""why are you excited about something it's supposed to do"" but believe me, I've had many others that didn't.",773
3335,"That being said, I needed these for listening to lectures and classes online and didn't want to put much money into it.",773
3336,i have seen the same review given by other people and it seems that they make this headphones just to rob money from people.,773
3337,"I bought this and the bth220 headphones and they have great sound quality and the first charge they lasted at least 16 hours, so with wear and tear over time I'm sure the 8 hour rating they give them will more than hold true.",773
3338,"They're low priced, but get the job done.",773
3339,"As I was saying, these headphones are fantastic because they are very light weight and good quality.",773
3340,For the price these are great headphones upon first impressions much better sound and build quality then a pair of Walmart brand for the same price.,773
3341,Haven't needed to charge the battery again yet.,773
3342,I also own the venerable V6's.,773
3343,"The ear cushions are small and barely covers my ears, and I have small ears.",773
3344,"Bought these a few years ago now as my primary pair at work, they're still going strong and do the job.",773
3345,"This was purchased to go with a pocket voice recorder, and has decent frequency response for voice recordings.",773
3346,"THEY FIT VERY WELL AND IT DOES HAVE A 3.5MM PLUG, SO I BOUGHT ADAPTERS FOR THE 1/4"" STANDARD FROM MY AMPS.",773
3347,I purchased one set each for my boys to go with their tablets.,773
3348,Provides descent quality sound and are durable.,773
3349,"I might be a little concerned about the ear pieces fabric fraying because of sweat, but as long as the sound stays good I don't much care.",773
3350,The sound is about as good as you can expect for $15.,774
3351,"A great value, too.",774
3352,I really wanted to get away from the wired ear buds I was using in the office as I would rip them out anytime I turned around.,774
3353,they make my head look rounder because they are a bit wide but the sound quality is great!,774
3354,I read one review which states the cords tangle though there's not been a problem with either set I have.,774
3355,Tried these in a store that is why I bought them.,774
3356,"When I listen to all my favorite song's the  sound's on this Sony stereo headphone's are great you can hear the music more,it tune's out any other sound around you.",774
3357,Range a little challenging sometimes.,774
3358,I also wanted wireless because I didn't want to be tied to my iPad - I wanted to be able to move around and do things while listening.,774
3359,So the new three star rating is for the company not the headset that gets a two tops.,774
3360,Other than that these have been excellent.,774
3361,Excellent value for your dollar.,774
3362,"Now I will say that these are my first pair of headphones, but from what I can tell the are really grate!",774
3363,It is hard for them to keep ear buds in their ears.,774
3364,"Sony did a great job on these...would buy another pair,for the price...you can't go wrong...",774
3365,The only negative is the strap around the head is not adjustable and stiff.,774
3366,and they also look awesome when i work out!,774
3367,A co-worker had these and so I decided to give them a try.,774
3368,Really happy with this purchase.,774
3369,"It might just be the pair I received, but the range on these are awful when in an open environment (i.e.",774
3370,"Once in a while, they'd nip one of my hairs in the joints.",774
3371,Not sure if the issue is rough use or manufacturing.,774
3372,The material appears sturdy enough.,774
3373,I would recommend these to anyone looking for bluetooth headphones at a decent price.,774
3374,"I use it when I'm gaming, doing homework, watching a movie in the Library, basically all the time.",774
3375,If you get these paired with your computer or phone you will enjoy these and LOVE the price.,775
3376,I tethered the locking velvet pouch to the outside of my back-pack for easy access and to keep them safe from my textbooks.,775
3377,I have to turn off the bluetooth on my phone and then take unit off to shut down.,775
3378,There have been other comments about sound quality not the greatest because of being Bluetooth but I think they sound fine.,775
3379,No bass to speak of.,775
3380,"For the price, I don't think that these 'phones can be beat.",775
3381,This wasn't a bad sound--if you like blues and jazz this set would be good with that warm sound.,775
3382,I haven't charge it yet and I have been using it for 8 hours from out of the box.,775
3383,"The Sony Stereo Headphones that I purchased from Amazon are just what I wanted to use with my I-Phone 5, from which I access music from my Amazon cloud.",775
3384,EDIT: I had a friend of mine (a youngish girl) try them on.,775
3385,"Until then, I won't be getting another pair and am likely to start looking for a replacement regular use headset.",775
3386,He is absolutely in love with these.,775
3387,They also get a little loose occasionally and the screws need to be tightened once in a while (especially if you fold them up regularly).,775
3388,"This may not sound like much to some, but in the world of audio and video, a one second delay makes content nearly unwatchable.",775
3389,For the price i paid i was actually not expecting the quality that came out of the speaker.,775
3390,These will be great for traveling.,775
3391,A co-worker had these and so I decided to give them a try.,775
3392,The only complaint I have is the cord.,775
3393,After this experience I decided to purchase another pair of 220's which I also enjoyed very much before my original pair failed.,775
3394,"At first glance and feel, the headphones, I admit, do feel fragile, almost like they're going to break; but, that isn't true.",775
3395,"Great sound quality, definitely 10/10
2.",775
3396,So far so good.,775
3397,Good quality sound for a half-decent price.,775
3398,"Sound in both ears is clear, they're comfortable for long periods of time, i've dropped them on numerous occasions and the plastic hasn't cracked or really scuffed at all.",775
3399,But when i buy this sony for remplace mines this was a big mistake!!!,775
3400,"The first few weeks, after about 45 minutes, I felt some mild ear soreness.",776
3401,I would not buy it again.,776
3402,I've only had the headphones about a week.,776
3403,I just got them today and they are not bad at all; good sound output and good looking.,776
3404,Amazon made it easy for me though.,776
3405,"Despite their compact on-ear size, these are very big head friendly.",776
3406,"So I'll write the review with that usage in mind:

Pros:  It's lightweight on your head and is comfortable as you move around.",776
3407,Pretty good for the price - just interface quirks.,776
3408,"FINALLY, we have it!",776
3409,They are snug and perhaps painful with extended use.,776
3410,"Overall if you're on a budget and can't really spend more than 20 bucks on headphones go with these, you won't be disappointed.",776
3411,They work perfect and we have no problem.,776
3412,"Given the price, this should be expected.",776
3413,I need a little tighter fit to make them a 5 star rating.,776
3414,I was a bit apprehensive before because I had never heard of the brand Kinivo.,776
3415,Use them mostly for listening to music.,776
3416,Does not drop signal continuously.,776
3417,"But as they are, I cannot recommend them.",776
3418,"Just recently the plug does not stay in all the way in the headphone jack of either my iPad Mini, my Lenovo Tablet, or the TV.",776
3419,It was simple to pair to my smartphone.,776
3420,They are great for the price if you just want to have a way to monitor things without bothering others.,776
3421,This is my second pair of kinivo blue tooth headphones.,776
3422,Good enough for me since i'm not that person who spends $$$ on audio quality...,776
3423,I've purchased three pairs of these for my kids (two pairs in white/pink and one in blue/black).,776
3424,After more than a year and it's still working like new!,776
3425,SO these are comfortable.,777
3426,I have a pair of white ones that are running 2 years strong right now!,777
3427,I love the way it sounds and feels.,777
3428,I plan on buying another pair soon.,777
3429,I was hoping they would balence out more and give better quality but that never happened.,777
3430,Kinivo BTTH240 Bluetooth Headphone is the excellence one.,777
3431,I even got a hug 3 days ago from the 9 year old for buying them.,777
3432,Then u have to keep wiggleing it to get it on both sides...  is any one else's like that?,777
3433,"I use these at work every day while I program, and I have no complaints.",777
3434,I even got a hug 3 days ago from the 9 year old for buying them.,777
3435,Unfortunately i have gone through 2 pairs of these and both no longer work within 2-3 months of using them 5-6 days a week.,777
3436,I now feel like I have either an oversized head or ears.,777
3437,5 stars because of the combination of product and customer service.,777
3438,"The arrangement with the microphone on the headset can work (on other brands), but it is not working well on this one.",777
3439,Might give this to my more petite wife and find something else!,777
3440,I am really hoping that the plastic band will stretch a little over time to make them looser.,777
3441,If you're looking for a pair of headphones as an audiophile I wouldn't recommend these.,777
3442,The head size is decent (I have a big head and it fits over my head comfortably).,777
3443,"No, I don't have a huge head.",777
3444,"Haven't really tested out the battery life or durability yet, but I suspect they will be more than sufficient.",777
3445,This is my second Kinivo and I absolutely enjoy it.,777
3446,"If you listen to music that isn't bass intensive or you don't really care about getting much bass, get these.",777
3447,I am very disappointed now though.,777
3448,"Excellent head phones..In fact I still have them after 5 years,ear padding is a bit worn out but the sound is still so good..",777
3449,"I'll have to continue using my older headphones over these, but I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.",777
3450,"Besides, they are comfortable to wear.",778
3451,It came on time as well.,778
3452,"For $10-15, these are great.",778
3453,Super durable I guess.,778
3454,"If you want the best sound and bass, don't be an insufferable cheap bstard and buy bose or beats.",778
3455,"I've had them for over 6 months now, and they've continued to work exceptionally well.",778
3456,yeah you can get beats for like a million bucks but why do that when these are just as good.,778
3457,"He told me to try a ""factory reset"" but that didn't work.",778
3458,"I had tried a couple other pair and always ran into the same problem, they were so uncomfortable that I couldn't wear them for more than 5 minutes without wanting to throw them across the room.",778
3459,Will not be purchasing this model again.,778
3460,"I was able to put it back in and use it still, but it pops out still every now and again.",778
3461,I readjust how they sit every once in a while.,778
3462,"They were ready to test right out of the box, and connected very easily to my phone and laptop.",778
3463,"I have used higher quality headphones, but they are usually too heavy for several hours of editing.",778
3464,"This is less than that, do not buy these.",778
3465,"We haven't opened yet as they are for a christmas present, but have purchased similar before.",778
3466,The music sounds very clear and the sound quality is great.,778
3467,This headphone meets my expectation for its price.,778
3468,Overall I have to say that I do like the headphones.,778
3469,And it allows me to be able to speak to the little kids without trying to speak above the sounds from his math blasting out from the speakers!,778
3470,"If its for regular use and just upgrading from stock headphones then go for it, but if your a audiophile and looking for some new bluetooth headphones skip these as you will be disappointed.",778
3471,"I was a little concerned when I found these headphones on Amazon because they had such great reviews and tons of them, at a great price, but I had never heard of the brand, nor had any of my friends, but I couldn't pass them up.",778
3472,"They may not be the best headphones out there, but they are a great deal, and still a good set of headphones.",778
3473,They are moderately comfortable but I would not wear them for more than an hour or so.,778
3474,Love how you can adjust for comfort.,778
3475,It is like they were made for kids?,779
3476,"Got what I wanted, nuff said.",779
3477,Love the feature that they fold flat for easy storage.,779
3478,"CONS---
There are none, I'm happy to report.",779
3479,Hmmm...glad I did get the red now that I think about it.,779
3480,I would characterize my head size as average for an adult male.,779
3481,We already had red ones so we knew they were great headphones.,779
3482,My old Logitech headphones were way better.,779
3483,"I don't care much about audio quality beyond a certain level of competence, but have gone through dozens of headphone models, and these are decent on that count, certainly better than your typical earbuds.",779
3484,Build quality is nice as well; sturdy plastic.,779
3485,These work great.,779
3486,I've had these headphones for all of one day.,779
3487,If you have hair this probably won't be an issue but its worth a mention.,779
3488,I was hoping the next iteration would be an upgrade all around.,779
3489,"As usual, the cord seems to be about 6 inches shorter than I need.",779
3490,"Even though, it isn't better than beats they still make AWESOME headphones!!",779
3491,The 90 degree plug is bulky and  rather awkward.,779
3492,I have some hearing deficit so it is much better to watch things on my Ipad with the headphones.,779
3493,I love it when a small change makes for a large improvement in user enjoyment.,779
3494,I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them like beats etc.,779
3495,The build quality on this pair is much higher however.,779
3496,For $30 you cannot complain though.,779
3497,"It's possible I just got a bad pair, but I suggest avoiding these anyway.",779
3498,"Plastic head strap seems sturdy enough, but it's day one.",779
3499,"I don't think that will be happening anymore as I have been using these since they arrived and they are great, easy to pair up and fit well.",779
3500,"If you sit or lay in absolute darkness, they can light up half the room lol.",780
3501,I need looking for the noise canceling headphone.,780
3502,"Overall, if the point is to listen to music, fine.",780
3503,"But if you want to spend some where under $30, might want to give these a try.",780
3504,This slight adjustment in design makes the control of the headphone much easier and more useful.,780
3505,Talk about cool in a restaurant.,780
3506,I'm surprised at how clear and easy they are to use.,780
3507,"these are nice, the bluetooth connection and not having to use a wire is nice, but these weren't loud enough for me, I used these in the gym the first day and it didn't block out all the gym noises like with my regular apple ear pods",780
3508,"are very comfortable, I like the color green, but on the picture they see green with white, and when they arrived they were green with beige, but equally the use that is given is good, we like a good buy",780
3509,You lose some of the clearness of the drums and the melodies from guitars are not as clear.,780
3510,"I bought it for my son, he loves it.",780
3511,"They are light and comfortable to wear, even while wearing glasses, and the pause, track-skip, volume, and phone functions work well.",780
3512,I am using it with my nano touch.,780
3513,Not really worth it.,780
3514,I needed new headphones because my last pair (a different brand) started only to play in one ear which many headphones do to me since they take a lot of abuse from me.,780
3515,I need a ponytail in place to hold the headband up so that it doesn't drift down.,780
3516,It's too bad because they sound very good IMO.,780
3517,I'd recommend these for any of the these reasons.,780
3518,"I just needed an affordable headphone for listening on mi IPhone and iPad,this works and was cheaper then stores near me.",780
3519,I will be returning them.,780
3520,The price was right so I figured I would give them a try.,780
3521,I got these headphones in an odd way.,780
3522,I've had a Kinivo BTH240 (black) headset for well over a year and had to buy my girlfriend one too (red).,780
3523,"Now he can walk around the room, listening to music, while his iPod is charging.",780
3524,And sometimes they send used products.,780
3525,I would press the wrong button and ignore a call rather than answering it.,781
3526,Pro- It works fine.,781
3527,"The sound is fine, exactly what you'd expect from Sony, even at $16 for the headphones.",781
3528,"I'm sure some people could care less about that, so take my review for what it is, my opinion.",781
3529,The music sounds very clear and the sound quality is great.,781
3530,Highly recommended.,781
3531,"I like this style of headphones for running as opposed to earphones, because the earphones fall out when I start running at higher speeds.",781
3532,They needed charging & so I charged it to full battery & they worked for an hour after turning them on & faded out.,781
3533,The only thing that is hard to navigate is the volume and next track buttons.,781
3534,The bass is disappointing by being barely audible and sounding muffled and unclear.,781
3535,If you're looking for a pair of headphones as an audiophile I wouldn't recommend these.,781
3536,They deliver very good sound with this receiver.,781
3537,They've toned down the strength of it.,781
3538,I highly recommend them.,781
3539,"The arrangement with the microphone on the headset can work (on other brands), but it is not working well on this one.",781
3540,(dollar store headphones) I could make out much less of the audio than I could with my existing headphones.,781
3541,I have to turn off the bluetooth on my phone and then take unit off to shut down.,781
3542,"So anyway the gadget is great, but I needed some headphones.",781
3543,It isn't surround-sound quality.,781
3544,I suggest getting a warranty.,781
3545,Bluetooth connectivity sometimes buggy with iphones.,781
3546,if you are in the market for an inexpensive bluetooth headset these are for you.,781
3547,I paired it with the TaoTronics TT-BA02 Wireless Portable Bluetooth Stereo Music Transmitter.,781
3548,I love the headphones.,781
3549,"Except that it's not for people with small head, it is a great product for casual listening",781
3550,I do recommend this product if you just need some basic bluetooth head gear.,782
3551,I will continue to use my $5 Koss headphones I got at Walmart.,782
3552,"so i can move around my room, untethered, and run to the bathroom or whatever, but i can't set music to play and then wander around the whole house.",782
3553,I do not recommend these headphones for anyone who has a large head.,782
3554,"If you are looking for a quality pair of headphones but do not want to spend a fortune, look no further!",782
3555,"Overall, if the point is to listen to music, fine.",782
3556,Just a very basic set of headphones.,782
3557,These headphones work really well.,782
3558,"So when these were on sale, I figured why not try them.",782
3559,"With those few cons in mind, they produced admirable sound quality, paired easily and never lost connection with my phone, and most importantly don't have cords and stayed on my ears!",782
3560,"Started up my music, my music taste runs from soft instrumental to heavily based rap and rock.",782
3561,Efficiency: This just means how loud they go.,782
3562,Plugging them into my computer at home was no better.,782
3563,These are great!,782
3564,They sound good and block out quite a bit of the surrounding noise.,782
3565,"For use with my IPad, the volume is a little low even at the max when watching Netflix.",782
3566,I am happy the ear pieces turn for storage.,782
3567,The Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone exceeded my expectations.,782
3568,Purchased these based on other reviews three weeks ago.,782
3569,"Normal use for it is something like ""Hardball,"" but last night I listened to a blues online radio site and the thing delivered spot-on sound.",782
3570,"I wasn't expecting great sound quality for the price, but I did expect them to work.",782
3571,I bought this headphone because it looks cool and carries a Sony name.,782
3572,I just wanted to get rid of the cord with traditional headphones because its always in my way when working out.,782
3573,"Wow, as another reviewer described, these are very uncomfortable, at least on my ears.",782
3574,"It's tolerable and does not cause a major issue, it's just a minor noticeable thing.",782
3575,Decent build...they are plastic and I'll have to be gentle with them.,783
3576,"FYI, these are awesome but they do not fold unless I am missing something!",783
3577,Only done side a little more bass would have been nice.,783
3578,Pairing is very easy.,783
3579,she crapped out on she so soon in less than a month  tried fo retuen it but it was going to cost $19 to return almost the same amount to.purchase it.,783
3580,"The treble is generally a little low, but you can change your EQ settings and it'll be fine.",783
3581,I was tired of having to worry about my headphone cords getting caught under something.,783
3582,"The way they wrap around the back of the neck makes it difficult to wear them while lying down or reclining, e.g.",783
3583,"I have bought many pairs of ear buds, all painful.",783
3584,"Fit well on any audio jack ipod, tablet, desktop, ds, psp, etc.!",783
3585,It came on time as well.,783
3586,Good for working out and casual listening.,783
3587,"The rigid behind the head bar is just a skotch too small, the phones might fall off if I move carelessly.",783
3588,"If you actually know anything about sound reproduction, these are great headphones!",783
3589,I really like these.,783
3590,I use these earphones primarily for watching TV while exercising at the gym or to listen to video clips on the computer.,783
3591,Mids and highs are very clear and crisp.,783
3592,"For the price and style, you cannot go wrong in buying these headphones.",783
3593,I bought these after years of wanting a pair of Bluetooth headphones and I am glad I did.,783
3594,"These are, in my opinion, quite a step up.",783
3595,"They worked fine before, but I have to say I'm very disappointed.",783
3596,I paid 29.99 for mine and I can't find anything wrong with them.,783
3597,Easy bluetooth connectivity to the iphone and ipad and good battery life.,783
3598,I listen to a lot of audio books and love these ear phones for than.,783
3599,"Smooth deep sounding bass, clear, crisp treble, almost no distortion at very high levels (not recommended).",783
3600,A great purchase for a reasonable price.,784
3601,"They are not what I expected, but they're great for the price.",784
3602,"Plus, if I lost it, I could find it by outputting music to it.",784
3603,I hated these headphones.,784
3604,I think they look stylish...we'll see if they agree.,784
3605,I use them at work and it's a great signal to others that I literally cannot hear them talking behind me since the headphones can be seen.,784
3606,"If you're looking for a affordable and good quality headphone, I will recommend these headphones.",784
3607,"I bought this and the bth220 headphones and they have great sound quality and the first charge they lasted at least 16 hours, so with wear and tear over time I'm sure the 8 hour rating they give them will more than hold true.",784
3608,The ear pads were ok for a short time but also became uncomfortable after extended periods of use.,784
3609,I've bought three generations of these headphones.,784
3610,I like the overall rating of this headphone.,784
3611,I listen to music most of the time at work and I can't constantly fiddle with these and get things done.,784
3612,I needed some new headphones when the old ones died.,784
3613,I would recommend either one and will most likey buy myself the Artic based on good base in any position.,784
3614,Good quality sound for a half-decent price.,784
3615,The play time has been good and about 8 hours on one charge.,784
3616,"The controls are a delight to use, and easy for your fingers to scope out, even though you can't see them.",784
3617,"The sound quality is good (not perfect, but still), and they don't break easily.",784
3618,Maybe wear them with a hat.,784
3619,I am very satisfied and encourage you to buy this headset.,784
3620,"Ears eventually start hurting from wearing too long
3.",784
3621,"Eye Glasses, earbuds,  scarves.",784
3622,I was hoping the next iteration would be an upgrade all around.,784
3623,"But if you're like me and would rather not spend hundreds of dollars on headphones, these work just fine.",784
3624,I do not recommend for adults.,784
3625,I will give these headphones 5 stars based on price.,785
3626,"The adapter is L shapped and bulky so if you have a case on your device (we are using a tablet), it is difficult to plug into it.",785
3627,Sound is actually pretty good.,785
3628,These are also pretty uncomfortable on your ears and becomes painful when worn for a long period of time.,785
3629,These would definitely be that product.,785
3630,the sound quality seems good and the headphones have held up well to use.,785
3631,"I was okay with all these, since I know they are a new company and will get to the point that they are making good products.",785
3632,These headphones were recommended to me by a colleague.,785
3633,I road my bike around the neighborhood with them on and they shifted alot and I just couldn't get them to sit comfortably on my BIG head,785
3634,"Overall, they aren't my favorite headphones, but they definitely do the job.",785
3635,"if you listen to music all the time, it may disappoint you.",785
3636,Buyers be aware!,785
3637,If anyone would find these painful it would be me.,785
3638,That's what the money buys and no more.,785
3639,"Durable, great quality.",785
3640,"I love that it adjusts, and it's easy to figure out which side is right vs. left (the red color goes on the right, by the way).",785
3641,I just didn't take it upon myself to actually see what that size would be.,785
3642,"Good range, love not being tethered to my phone, and can still listen to my music from two rooms away.",785
3643,After looking for a while Igave up and just bought cheap... WELL little did I know that they would be just what I wanted.,785
3644,Battery last for me about 9 hours on full charge while at work listening to music for that entire time.,785
3645,"After a day...
PROs: Comfortable headset (sure beats ear buds), good sound quality, easy to set up.",785
3646,"I bought this obviously for 3 reasons: cheap price, positive average reviews, and the brand.",785
3647,The cheap Sony brand works just fine.,785
3648,I use this for my PC.,785
3649,"However, under Ubuntu the microphone does not work, even when HSP profile is selected.",785
3650,"They are compatible with every music/sound device that I own like my laptop, phone, mp3 player and radio.",786
3651,He immediately reacted to listening to music on both my phone or a CD player.,786
3652,Happy with my purchase!,786
3653,I needed new headphones because my last pair (a different brand) started only to play in one ear which many headphones do to me since they take a lot of abuse from me.,786
3654,"One instance last week I got up to about 30 or 40 feet before it started to drop out, although there was also a wall separating me and my phone.",786
3655,"She wanted to buy some new headphones with her birthday money, so I told her no more than $20.",786
3656,"I like them, so I will probably continue to use them, but i wish they were more comfortable.",786
3657,"Any movement of my head, and the phones slip off and become annoyingly uncomfortable in a hurry.",786
3658,"So, I figured since I was happy with Sony, that would be the place to look.",786
3659,Very decent headphones for the price!,786
3660,"The microphone does not register anything at all until you are speaking at COMICALLY LOUD VOLUMES, and my guildies on ventrilo tell me the mic sounds like I'm yelling into an old time radio inside a tin can underwater.",786
3661,Music is full and clear.,786
3662,It's bass heavy (which I like) and clear.,786
3663,Folds up neatly for travelling.,786
3664,"I got some earbuds after that, but honestly I hate them more than anything, so I was so happy when I found these on Amazon.",786
3665,I fully recommend.,786
3666,"I've been using it for a good 4 month to this date by now, and so far I had absolutely no trouble nor any malfunctions.",786
3667,I've tried turning them up as loud as I could with volume on my iPhone and on the headphones and they still aren't that loud.,786
3668,"So anyway the gadget is great, but I needed some headphones.",786
3669,Pretty comfortable.,786
3670,They have a soft rubber cover over where the wire meets the male connector (i.e.,786
3671,Bass is actually quite well and you will enjoy listening to your music on these.,786
3672,The sound is good and acceptable.,786
3673,"Overall, they are well worth the money.",786
3674,Received the headphones as stated on the order.,786
3675,And by the time I realized this I was out of the return window.,787
3676,Only think I wish it did was fold up for compatibility... Other than that I'm a satisfied mommy!,787
3677,"Purchased in late May 2015 and just discovered it died, will not charge - I got about 18 months of use out of it, but really expected more for the price (around $25 at time of purchase).",787
3678,"For the price and style, you cannot go wrong in buying these headphones.",787
3679,I've had them for about 8 workouts now and they've been great!,787
3680,Works like it says it does.,787
3681,I like this much better.,787
3682,I use them at work all the time.,787
3683,"And they look nice with whatever I wear, plus when I want to not use them and wear them instead they're small enough to have around your neck without choking.",787
3684,SONY consistently delivers good quality.,787
3685,I wish I would have spent a bit more money and purchased ones with oval ear cups instead.,787
3686,"Since these headphones are placed on the back of neck, it is hard to tell you whether they are going to fit you.",787
3687,I would purchase these again.,787
3688,I think it actually lasts longer too.,787
3689,"But again, it lacks the hardshell protection from heavier objects.",787
3690,"Hopefully with further tweaking, the snugness of the fit and consistency of the audio quality can be improved in future models.",787
3691,Usually I'm lucky if they last 6 months.,787
3692,Easy bluetooth connectivity to the iphone and ipad and good battery life.,787
3693,Owned these for a little over two years with light to moderate use through that time.,787
3694,"Iron Maiden, Reel Big Fish, and The Smashing Pumpkins all sound horrid and bland on these.",787
3695,"If you consider the price, it can't be any better than this product.",787
3696,Husband loves them really good working.,787
3697,I'm still contemplating reordering because I do like them.,787
3698,"This was a gift to a friend, but I also have a black one and I use it everyday.",787
3699,Not tight fitting at all and would fall of if you have to bend down quickly to pick something up.,787
3700,I ordered another pair and they came right away.,788
3701,A great purchase for a reasonable price.,788
3702,"Takes a bit to adjust to control location(skipped a few songs,dropped a few calls,but great product for the price",788
3703,I either take them off or shift them so that they're hanging on the top part of my ear instead of the part of my ear connected to my head.,788
3704,for someone who is really clumsy and is used to breaking headphones all the time this is perfect.,788
3705,Battery life is awesome and last me at least 2 days with heavy use.,788
3706,"Nice sound, nice fit, easy to use--what more can one want?",788
3707,"If you wear a larger hat size, these headphones are probably not for you.",788
3708,"The buttons are easily accessible, but they do sit flush with the hardware, so it's a little tough to tell if you're finger's in the right place if you're wearing gloves.",788
3709,Both sets died within a week of each other.,788
3710,They just apologize and send another.,788
3711,And that's what I mostly listen to.,788
3712,They are on fashion here in Ecuador and my daughters love them.,788
3713,They must have used a tiny model in the photo.,788
3714,"Got these headphones based on a review in a magazine, and it was spot on.",788
3715,I specifically wanted pure white headphones (that one little red line doesn't bother me; it helps me distinguish right v. left ear),788
3716,"We don't use them everyday but for the occassional use, they are just great and the price is terrific - for the money, you we think you can't go wrong!",788
3717,Well worth the buy.,788
3718,I've owned the BHT220 for years...they finally started acting up so I jumped to these.,788
3719,Very pleased thus far with the product and  Blue Rigger service.,788
3720,"Really Sony, 3 ft?",788
3721,(dollar store headphones) I could make out much less of the audio than I could with my existing headphones.,788
3722,People mistake it from dre.,788
3723,"Not as ""fancy"" as beats quality headphones, material is definitely on the cheaper side.",788
3724,Fit is good for adults with an average to above average size head.,788
3725,I found these particular headphones to be very uncomfortable.,789
3726,Used my 220s for over a year(8-10 hours a day) and they recently started having speaker issues so I upgraded to these.,789
3727,I would definitely recommend them!,789
3728,I don't know why this product has so many good reviews.,789
3729,"Removing the consideration of price, I give these 3 stars.",789
3730,There have been other comments about sound quality not the greatest because of being Bluetooth but I think they sound fine.,789
3731,I saved a ton of money and the headphones audio is superb!,789
3732,I gave these only 4 stars simply because I don't have any high-end sets to compare them with.,789
3733,"Typically, I wear them while walking or taking public transportation, so no real advantage for me.",789
3734,"The microphone does not register anything at all until you are speaking at COMICALLY LOUD VOLUMES, and my guildies on ventrilo tell me the mic sounds like I'm yelling into an old time radio inside a tin can underwater.",789
3735,Works like it says it does.,789
3736,Now I can listen in comfort.,789
3737,So I bought a pair for my wife.,789
3738,I have bought Bluetooth headphones before and they were always poor sounding when bass kicked in.,789
3739,"Given the price, this should be expected.",789
3740,"The reason I don't score higher is this: cord does not separate from headphones, so if it goes, you have to replace all.",789
3741,Not a DJ-ing headset because of it's it limited mobility.,789
3742,The only complaint that I have is the headband isn't quite big enough for my head.,789
3743,Perfect for travelers who are looking for fewer wires to mess with while lounging at the airport.,789
3744,I need a new pair now and will try to avoid buying this model for those reasons alone.,789
3745,They are also as it stated on arrival-refurbished.,789
3746,"I received a replacement set within a few days, with no hassle.",789
3747,Only finally found ONE image.,789
3748,Got the headphones for my son as throw aways because he is very hard on headsets.,789
3749,The  red light was on while plugged in.,789
3750,Bass is actually quite well and you will enjoy listening to your music on these.,790
3751,They are compact and lightweight.,790
3752,"The sound is crisp and clear, and they are pretty loud.",790
3753,If that is the purpose it is,790
3754,Only draw back is when they're on people can hear the music you're playing and I was looking for a pair of headphones that I can use while my son is napping or in the bed while I'm working during the wee hours.,790
3755,These are also very sturdy.,790
3756,I've had these headphones for all of one day.,790
3757,I don't wear them for more than a couple hours.,790
3758,Knocked rating down to one star because of this.,790
3759,Now I still have to buy another headset.,790
3760,They stay put without issue.,790
3761,"Overall, I'm satisfied with them for the price they were.",790
3762,Headphones relatively comfortable.,790
3763,This headset is equal to a much higher priced set.,790
3764,"I do clean them every so often, so I don't know if it's just that they are dirty and making my skin itch, or if I am having an allergic reaction to the material.",790
3765,"i also haven't been very gentle with them, so i tend to take them off by sliding them off one ear and kinda yanking them off the other in one swift motion...and the frame hasn't twisted or bent in any way.",790
3766,And I that goes for the two pair that I bought so I know that it wasn't just a lemon that I got.,790
3767,Sony's website lists them as not circumaural[0].,790
3768,1 star for the product.,790
3769,I bought this headset to use with my Samsung Tablet.,790
3770,For the price a quality product,790
3771,As far as I can tell awesome product.,790
3772,"Pros:
-Well built
-Good price

Cons:
-Wire randomly twists after normal use

the wires twist into themselves after using them for only a few days.",790
3773,This slight adjustment in design makes the control of the headphone much easier and more useful.,790
3774,"Of course they do not get as good sound as my Beats by Dr. Dre Studio's, but great overall value.",790
3775,If anything ever happens to them we will definitely be repurchasing!,791
3776,"At this moment, I am listening to music on my GNote with this headset and I am hearing both excellent treble and bass.",791
3777,"So much that if I leave them on my ears for more than about 30-45 minutes, it starts to hurt.",791
3778,"Not expensive, but not cheap.",791
3779,"Also, they look really bad haha.",791
3780,The price was right so I figured I would give them a try.,791
3781,"They are not the top of the line, but if you just want comfortable headphones for regular listening...these are great!",791
3782,"As for ambient sounds, when you are wearing them, they are a bit muffled, but not blocked.",791
3783,I suspect that has more to do with Windows 8 being a terrible OS than anything else.,791
3784,"Normally I'm not one to write negative reviews, but yikes, I'm pretty dissatisfied with these headphones, even for the $20 I paid.",791
3785,"I purchased these headphones for my iPhone 5 and iPad, they were extremely easy to set up, they sound great and they are super comfortable on my head.",791
3786,"Nice headphones for the money, but the mic and noise canceling is very poor.",791
3787,"My feedback isn't on the sound quality, just that the ears pieces are an awkward size and really uncomfortable for me.",791
3788,"If you want some over the head earphones and you don't want to spend more than 30 dollars, these are a must buy.",791
3789,"Cons: not really loud, its plastic, Earcups aren't really comfortable",791
3790,"They're a little big at the back, so when I lay flat it does get pushed a bit, but not uncomfortably so.",791
3791,They are also very comfortable to wear.,791
3792,These headphones get the job done.,791
3793,"can't even return them they, as they are already out of the return policy.",791
3794,I've had a pair of these (white) for three years and they are still going strong.,791
3795,"I got them last year for my birthday and usually with headphones, they don't last for a long time.",791
3796,I wish their quality control was better.,791
3797,The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because they drop calls - even when you have a wifi assisted connection.,791
3798,I saved a ton of money and the headphones audio is superb!,791
3799,"I've just been using them for a couple of days so far, but I am very pleased.",791
3800,They feel cheap but you what you pay for.,792
3801,There was no reason to by the DRE.,792
3802,It folds up nicely for travel.,792
3803,"Now they are probably a little bigger than what you think, but they fit nice around your ears, and provide some noise cancellation because of that.",792
3804,I find that I don't even realize that I am wearing them.,792
3805,I bought these headphones due to a review by the wirecutter and I can say that it lived up to their praise.,792
3806,The shipping was fast and product as described.,792
3807,Bluetooth range not great but not a detractor.,792
3808,"The combo sounds clear, lows are present but not pronounced some what tinney but I wasn't expecting a high end product so it's good for a quick fix or road trip, get them at walmart  $30.00.",792
3809,"Purchased for my teenager who knew she wasn't going to get the $200 headphones, and she's very pleased with them.",792
3810,My guess is that the batteries started to wear.,792
3811,It's a little annoying.,792
3812,Because the headphone is not adjustable to your head i try to put the plastic piece over my ears which hurts after a while.,792
3813,"I would maybe recommend looking up modded upgrades with these phones if you want to push it further, sound wise.",792
3814,"It's not the most comfortable experience if you wear glasses, and it makes leaning your head back uncomfortable.",792
3815,I had to call Apple and they were able to help me pair it.,792
3816,"Obviously I can hear well enough or I would have replaced them, but still.",792
3817,A design plus is the red band on the right side.,792
3818,"You can pay a lot more but for a basic head set for your grand kids, this is the one.",792
3819,"What we got was impressive sound (sure a set of $300 headphones probably sound a little better, but not much), and impressive durability.",792
3820,Only foolish people with too much money pay more than this for headphones.,792
3821,I rarely use it.,792
3822,Bought two of them and they work great.,792
3823,They arrived quickly.,792
3824,"So basically the warm, good looking, great sounding headphones!",792
3825,"The volume does not go very loud, and has little to no bass.",793
3826,Sound wise they equal to much more expensive headsets but this problem is enough to turn you off.,793
3827,I can't use earbuds and corded phones are such a nuisance.,793
3828,They are durable and sound great.,793
3829,but once i put them on i realized they had amazing quality.,793

3910,"It's light weight, portable, comfortable, low profile easy to use and rugged.",796
3911,"I bought this obviously for 3 reasons: cheap price, positive average reviews, and the brand.",796
3912,"I liked the first one while it worked, then ordered two more when the first set stopped working suddenly.",796
3913,But these are the best so far with good highs and lows and bass is good and the treble is about mid range and they work very well with a high end media player too.,796
3914,They actually provide a decent sound dampening from any outside noise even though they are not noise cancelling.,796
3915,They are not the best head phones in the world but the fact that they are Sony and cost an affordable price makes them great to use.,796
3916,..All at 20 dollars?,796

3926,And they are good for that.,797
3927,I listen to music most of the time at work and I can't constantly fiddle with these and get things done.,797
3928,BTW its only day 1 so I will follow up with how they hold up in the long run.,797
3929,Also no static at all.,797
3930,"It's not as long as my last set of headphones, which would probably be good for someone using them for anything other than what I use them for, which is sitting at my computer.",797
3931,The cable and plug are also very sturdy.,797
3932,"Regardless, the headphones produce studio quality sound and even though they were white and used, there was not one indication as far as discoloration goes that they were used at all.",797
3933,These are perfect for the price.,797

3960,it kinda is even too long for me (im 5'7).,798
3961,"For the price point, these are mediocre headphones.",798
3962,"I run, so I hate those little earbuds because they always fall out and they irritate my ear.",798

3981,"A good fit over the ear is also a bit difficult to achieve if you have a smaller head, and I suspect if you had a larger head as well.",799
3982,In the sound department they're both great and I have no issue with that.,799
3983,"As far as compatibility, the work with Windows Laptop, Windows Phone (1520 and 920 used), as well as any of our Samsung Galaxy devices.",799

3987,Only complaint - and it's a minor one - is that they pinch my glasses into my head behind the ears and it's kind of uncomfortable.,799
